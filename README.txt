# directed-summarisation-w-amr

*Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the MSc Artificial Intelligence of Imperial College London.*

This repository contains the software used to conduct the experiments in my thesis *Directed summarisation with Abstract Meaning Representation and Moral Foundation Theory*. The pipeline described in the thesis report can be run on the `Project Pipeline.ipynb` Colab notebook when the IP ('Individual Project') repository is uploaded into Google Drive storage.

Original code is found in the `.ipynb` files and `u-sas` modules which are supplemented with new functions. The pipeline makes use of the following open-source models and source code:
* `amrlib`: https://github.com/bjascob/amrlib
* `argument_classification`: https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2019-BERT-argument-classification-and-clustering
* `e2e-coref`: https://github.com/kentonl/e2e-coref
* `stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05`: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/
* `u-sas`: https://github.com/vgupta123/Unsupervised-SAS (edited for the purpose of directed summarisation)
