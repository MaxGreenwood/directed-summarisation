You must know what 's really driving the immigration debate . <eos> It 's the culture , stupid . <eos> Ruben Navarrette Jr. : Some opponents of immigration , even the legal kind , fear changes in local culture . <eos> Immigration restrictionists -- and by that , I mean those who want to limit all immigration , even the legal kind -- like to pretend they 're so high-minded . <eos> Yet they ca n't help themselves . <eos> They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants . <eos> The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns : that our borders are n't secure , that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally , and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here . <eos> Really ? . <eos> If that 's the extent of it , then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards . <eos> That seems to be the issue in North Dakota , where , according to a recent article in USA Today , towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them . <eos> In Cooperstown , the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy , because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who ? . <eos> American kids who work at Starbucks ? . <eos> Nope . <eos> The article quotes Orville Tranby , a local community leader in Cooperstown , who says that some residents have told him `` face to face '' that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture . <eos> You 'll find the same fear in Lewisburg , Tennessee . <eos> Not long ago , an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish . <eos> Townspeople wanted no part of that . <eos> They demanded that all books purchased by the library , or even donated , be in English-only . <eos> These stories are ridiculous , but they 're also helpful . <eos> They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration , and it goes well beyond words like `` legal '' or `` illegal . '' . <eos> It 's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic , that Spanish is replacing English , that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity , and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico . <eos> A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the `` colonization '' of the United States . <eos> This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy , that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners , and that our children are going to live in a world where they 're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up . <eos> It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century , who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English , but would `` swarm into our Settlements , and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours . '' . <eos> It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were `` unassimilable , '' which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 . <eos> And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants ( read : the Irish ) were diluting `` the quality of ( U.S. ) citizenship '' and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated , low skilled , apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity . <eos> Where have we heard that before ? . <eos> And when will we hear it again ? . <eos> After all , Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists . <eos> But they wo n't be the last . <eos> Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . <eos> You can read his column here . <eos> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
In the days after Benazir Bhutto 's assassination , it will be tempting to reach two hasty conclusions : that she was Pakistan 's last great hope and that her geo-politically crucial country has revealed itself to be inherently hopeless . <eos> Irshad Manji is a controversial Muslim feminist and activist from Toronto , Canada . <eos> On each front , I take a different view . <eos> While far more liberal and democratic than Gen. Musharraf , Bhutto disappointed moderate , modern Pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics . <eos> Writing to me through my Web site , American feminists say they are `` aching '' over the loss of `` our dear , sweet , brave Benazir . '' . <eos> I understand the sentiment . <eos> But `` brave '' is not the word used by Pakistani women from whom I 've also heard . <eos> They 're hurting more over Bhutto 's `` self-imposed '' conformity . <eos> `` She never realized her potential , '' a woman from Karachi tells me . <eos> `` And not because she was killed but because when she had the chance , she did not effectively challenge the backward mindset that has now led to her demise . '' . <eos> For example , during Bhutto 's time in office , Pakistan did n't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws . <eos> Those notorious ordinances , known as Hudood , took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as Islam . <eos> Watch Manji argue on CNN why Bhutto 's legacy is mixed » . <eos> Imagine the opportunity : Bhutto could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices . <eos> In so doing , she might have created allies among conservatives , who can be persuaded that although Islam is God-given , culture is man-made . <eos> Last year , a media campaign to strike down the Hudood Ordinances achieved this fine balance . <eos> But not because of her . <eos> And that , say many progressive Pakistanis , amputates Bhutto 's legacy . <eos> The fact that cruel laws against women can be publicly debated at all should suggest that Pakistan has hope anyway . <eos> An exceptional leader can tap into it . <eos> History tells us so . <eos> There was a time when Pakistan 's democratic politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics . <eos> Bhutto 's father , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist . <eos> `` You drink alcohol ! '' . <eos> shouted the critic . <eos> `` Yes , '' retorted the elder Bhutto , `` but I do n't drink the blood of the people ! '' . <eos> His response captured the spirit of Muhammad Ali Jinnah , Pakistan 's founder . <eos> In 1947 , Jinnah exuded high hopes for his people : `` You are free . <eos> You are free to go to your temples , you are free to go to your mosques , or to any other place of worship in the State of Pakistan . <eos> `` You may belong to any religion or caste or creed . <eos> That has nothing to do with the business of the state . <eos> We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens of one state ... You will find that in due course of time , Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims , not in the religious sense ... but in the political sense as citizens of the state . '' . <eos> Jinnah meant every word of his unconventional vision because he , himself , lived as a maverick . <eos> He adored his non-Muslim wife , and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail . <eos> Her visibility attested to Islam 's embrace of women as partners of men . <eos> In the months ahead , the people of Pakistan will need to recall Jinnah 's vision . <eos> It may be of comfort know that they 're not alone . <eos> Countless Americans are now asking about their founders ' intentions , desperate to re-discover the better angels of their country after eight years of George W. Bush . <eos> Still , Pakistan must avoid America 's enduring mistake . <eos> The United States lapsed into profound divisiveness following the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy . <eos> Many would argue that today 's politics of polarization can be traced to the unresolved trauma of the King-Kennedy murders . <eos> For Pakistan , it 's high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism . <eos> I pray that in death , Benazir Bhutto will be the catalyst for a deeper democracy than she ever advocated in life . <eos> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
On the question of whether recent immigrants assimilate as quickly as previous waves , many Americans exhibit short fuses -- and even shorter memories . <eos> Ruben Navarrette Jr. notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating . <eos> They have convinced themselves that , instead of adapting to the customs of this country , new arrivals -- most of whom come from Asia or Latin America -- expect the rest of us to accommodate them . <eos> They go ballistic over little things -- Mexican flags , taco trucks , libraries that offer bilingual story time , or having to `` press one for English . '' . <eos> Yet , even as they look down on new immigrants , many Americans look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors . <eos> Legend has it that when grandpa arrived from Ireland , Germany , Italy or Poland , he jumped off the boat , immediately draped himself in the American flag , ripped out his native tongue , and abandoned his culture -- all while singing `` Yankee Doodle Dandy . '' . <eos> Germans did not move to Milwaukee and make beer and cheese . <eos> The Irish did not settle in Boston and join organizations like the Hibernian Society to preserve their heritage and culture . <eos> And even while Americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants are n't like their predecessors , they miss the irony : At the time , there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors ; the Germans were thought to not be like the English , the Irish were n't like the Germans , the Italians were n't like the Irish etc . <eos> And the Chinese were n't like anyone who had come before them , and so they were labeled `` unassimilable '' by the Tom Tancredos of that era . <eos> Some things never change . <eos> When I was growing up in Central California , which is home to a large population of immigrants from Southeast Asia , thousands would gather to celebrate Hmong New Year . <eos> The local newspaper would do a feature . <eos> And , in the days that followed , someone would write an angry letter to the editor complaining that these people were n't melting into the pot . <eos> Yet , there is more melting going on than one might think , according to a new report from the Manhattan Institute . <eos> Billed as the first annual Index of Immigrant Assimilation , the study was written by Duke University Professor Jacob Vigdor . <eos> It measured three kinds of assimilation : economic ( employment , education , homeownership , etc . <eos> ) ; cultural ( intermarriage , English proficiency , family size , etc . <eos> ) ; and civic ( citizenship , military service , political participation , etc . ) . <eos> Far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process , the study found that `` immigrants of the past quarter-century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago , even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival . '' . <eos> Of course , individual groups still fall behind in some categories . <eos> Chinese and Indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation . <eos> Mexican immigrants have low levels of economic assimilation . <eos> And Canadian and Indian immigrants have low levels of civic assimilation , since few of them become citizens . <eos> But , overall , the news is good . <eos> After more than 200 years , America still does an excellent job of assimilating immigrants . <eos> Even if a particular group tried to resist the process , they would n't stand a chance . <eos> Assimilation happens , whether the immigrants are ready or not . <eos> Those are the facts . <eos> Of course , fear does n't listen to facts . <eos> That is something else that has n't changed . <eos> Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . <eos> Read his column here .
In a recent commentary , I wrote that , as a Mexican-American , the ugliness of the immigration debate offends me -- not as a Mexican , but as an American . <eos> Ruben Navarrette Jr. lists 10 things U.S.-born Hispanics find distasteful about the immigration debate . <eos> A woman wrote in and asked me to be more specific : Just what was it about the immigration debate that was so ugly ? . <eos> She came to the right place . <eos> After nearly 20 years of writing opinions and insisting that I do n't speak for all Hispanics , in recent months , I 've heard from hundreds of Hispanics who -- appreciative of my middle-ground approach to the immigration issue -- insist that I can speak for them anytime . <eos> So , with the authority vested in me , I 'll now share some of what other Hispanics are saying . <eos> It 's not far off from what Janet Murguia had to say . <eos> As president of the National Council of La Raza , the largest Hispanic civil rights organization in the United States , Murguia recently delivered an important speech to the National Press Club . <eos> The topic : the immigration debate and what she called a wave of hate sweeping the land -- one that is n't limited to illegal immigrants , but which is now affecting all Hispanics regardless of where they were born , what language they speak or what flag they salute . <eos> The way Murguia sees it , immigration is `` on the verge of becoming one of the largest civil rights issues of our generation . '' . <eos> And , Hispanics are playing the piñata . <eos> Murguia was right on the button . <eos> To borrow a phrase , it 's getting ugly out there . <eos> And U.S.-born Hispanics see it as plain as day . <eos> Here are 10 things they find distasteful about this debate : . <eos> • The hypocrisy . <eos> We have two signs on the U.S.-Mexican border : `` Keep Out '' and `` Help Wanted . '' . <eos> • The racism . <eos> With lightning speed , the debate went from anti-illegal immigrant to anti-immigrant to anti-Mexican . <eos> • The opportunism . <eos> Too many politicians are trying too hard to portray themselves as tough on illegal immigration . <eos> • The simple solutions . <eos> `` Build A Wall . '' . <eos> `` Deport All Illegals . '' . <eos> A quick rule of thumb : If it fits on a bumper sticker , it 's not a workable policy . <eos> • The naiveté . <eos> People ask why Mexico wo n't help stop illegal immigration . <eos> Hint : Last year , Mexicans in the United States sent home $ 25 billion . <eos> • The profiling . <eos> Dark skin and Spanish surnames should n't be proxies for undocumented status . <eos> Been to Arizona lately ? . <eos> • The meanness . <eos> Nazi-produced Internet video games let players shoot illegal immigrants crossing the border . <eos> Fun stuff . <eos> • The amnesia . <eos> Americans think grandpa was welcomed with open arms and that he plunged into the melting pot . <eos> Whatever . <eos> • The buck-passing . <eos> Americans love to blame Mexico for their choices , yelling across the border : `` Stop us before we hire again . '' . <eos> • The double standard . <eos> The same folks who have zero tolerance for illegal immigrants easily tolerate those who hire them . <eos> Some of this is painfully familiar , recalling earlier versions of this debate as it played out a hundred or two hundred years ago . <eos> Hispanics are the new Germans , the new Irish , the new Italians . <eos> But it 's also ugly . <eos> It was then . <eos> It is now . <eos> Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . <eos> Read his column here . <eos> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
My love for University of Memphis basketball is completely irrational . <eos> I never went to school there and have no affiliation with the university . <eos> But I bleed Tiger blue . <eos> My dad used to take my brothers and me to Memphis games as a kid , and I 've been hooked ever since . <eos> We once bought tickets from a scalper for six bucks apiece against arch-rival the University of Louisville in the 1980s . <eos> My dad complained we paid too much . <eos> But then we moved in seventh grade . <eos> I became an even bigger fan after we left the city . <eos> I 'd huddle over my AM radio , hooked up with a coat hanger wrapped in aluminum foil as an antenna . <eos> More than 350 miles away , I managed to pick up the then-Memphis State games through the crackle and static of the radio . <eos> Memphis basketball was my only way to remain connected to my youth and the city that I loved . <eos> That was 1985 , the last time Memphis made the Final Four . <eos> Is your team in the Final Four ? . <eos> Send your iReport celebratory photos . <eos> Back then , Memphis was led by a phenom named Keith Lee . <eos> He was best known for a sweet baseline jumper as soft as the nylon nets he swished . <eos> He was also known for his giant Afro . <eos> He was listed as 6 feet 10 inches . <eos> The joke was if you included his wild hairdo , he was 7-4 . <eos> When my parents were away at work , sometimes I 'd sneak into my mom 's cabinet , steal her mousse and then put it in my hair . <eos> Then this white kid would go out back and shoot hoops for hours , hair sticking straight out like I stuck my finger in a socket . <eos> It was the only way I could be like Lee , my hero and idol . <eos> Back then , Memphians would rank Lee right up there with Elvis Presley as the city 's most popular icons . <eos> Many still do . <eos> And that 's the thing about Tiger basketball . <eos> In a place where race has often divided so much of it , Memphis basketball has helped unite the city . <eos> As a boy , white and black kids would crowd the basketball court at Tiger games to try to snatch the players ' sweatbands as they raced into the locker room . <eos> Up until I graduated from high school , the sweatbands of Phillip `` Doom '' Haynes and Baskerville `` Batman '' Holmes sat on my shelf in my room . <eos> Like a fan of any team , there have been good and bad times over the years . <eos> But sometimes the pain of being a Tiger fan is that much greater . <eos> Tragedy and heartbreak are part of it , such as when Holmes killed his girlfriend and then himself in 1997 . <eos> Other players , such as Aaron Price and A. Maceo Battle , have died far too young along the way , furthering the pain of being a fan . <eos> Larry Finch -- who as a black player brought together the city and took Memphis to its only national championship game in 1973 , and later became one of its greatest coaches -- has lived much of the past few years in a rehabilitation center after suffering severe strokes . <eos> In some ways , that 's what makes Memphis basketball so special . <eos> Memphis players embody the real life of so many Americans , many faced with extreme hard times . <eos> Some succeed ; some do n't . <eos> Others , such as Finch , keep on fighting . <eos> I do n't find it an accident that Memphis is now seeking history the same week of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev . <eos> Martin Luther King Jr. `` I think Dr. King would find this a source of joy , '' the Rev . <eos> Jesse Jackson told the team this week , according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper . <eos> A city that has seen so much pain , so much heartache , has something huge to celebrate -- all revolving around young college kids and a bouncy orange ball . <eos> The adage is that sports often have the ability to transcend the moment . <eos> This is one of those times . <eos> To get to the championship game Monday night , Memphis must first get past UCLA , the same team that defeated it in that 1973 title game . <eos> While much of the rest of the nation has the team pegged to lose , the Tigers -- for one shining moment -- have a chance to do something really special . <eos> They 'd have it no other way . <eos> As for me ? . <eos> I wo n't be listening on my old radio , but this weekend I might just try sporting that 'do like Keith Lee . <eos> The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of the writers .
Nothing says true love like releasing a caged butterfly , do n't you think ? . <eos> Wayne Rooney and Coleen McLoughlin are to be paid $ 5 million for the picture rights to their wedding . <eos> The butterflies are reported to be the piece-de-resistance of England 's most anticipated celebrity wedding of the year . <eos> Wayne Rooney , the best English footballer of his generation , and Coleen McLoughlin , his High School sweetheart , were to marry in an estimated $ 10 million ceremony in Italy Thursday . <eos> As they kiss , guests are apparently meant to open boxes and release the butterflies . <eos> The moment has been pilloried widely in the British media , tacky and over the top they all think , but is it just sour grapes ? . <eos> It has been a long and , at times , bumpy road for the couple to the altar . <eos> One littered with fierce criticism from the British press , which has enjoyed nothing more than lampooning Rooney and McLoughlin for being 'common . ' . <eos> The Daily Mail once even asked : `` Is this Britain 's ghastliest couple ? '' . <eos> Rooney has been dubbed `` Shrek '' and `` Mr Potato Head '' due to his looks and his background as the son of a school dinner lady who grew up on a council estate is often referred to in a disparaging way . <eos> McLoughlin , meanwhile , has been subjected to page upon page of bitter stories about her weight , shopping sprees and her lack of closeness to Victoria Beckham . <eos> There has also been fierce criticism over the fact she has managed to become a millionaire in her own right . <eos> It 's all down to Rooney apparently , and nothing to do with her appearing to be quite a decent person , who did well at school and has cleverly managed to parlay some of her fame into various media and advertising projects . <eos> Anyone who has seen her television show -- Coleen 's Real Women -- can see she is a decent , bubbly person , who is very good at putting people at ease . <eos> Much to the media 's fury , the couple have sold the rights to cover the wedding to OK magazine for a record $ 5 million . <eos> However they 're not pocketing all the cash themselves , with an undisclosed sum from the fee to be donated to the Claire House children 's hospice in Cheshire -- where McLoughlin 's disabled foster sister Rosie is cared for . <eos> The queen 's grandson , Peter Phillips and his bride Autumn Kelly , recently received $ 1m from Hello magazine to cover their wedding but they did n't receive an eighth of the opprobrium now directed at the more generous , but lower class , Rooney and McLoughlin . <eos> Moreover , in lieu of presents , Rooney and McLoughlin have also asked guests to donate money to the Alder Hey children 's hospital in Liverpool . <eos> The wedding might be over the top , with a private yacht and luxury jet for guests ( they are covering the guests ' costs ) , expensive plonk and a $ 200,000 wedding dress , but at least the couple have worked hard for what they have . <eos> Their success despite a working-class background appears to be the greatest source of frustration for critics . <eos> It 's just not on that someone who was n't born into privilege and did n't go to a posh school can enjoy their wealth . <eos> That would be ugly . <eos> If anything , the couple 's relationship and success is a triumph over adversity . <eos> They have known each other since McLoughlin was 12 , but she spent two years fending off Rooney 's entreaties to go out on a date . <eos> He finally got his chance when he saw her struggling to fix a broken bicycle chain . <eos> He rode over to help , popped the question again and got a yes . <eos> Surely they should be congratulated for creating their own modern fairytale complete with butterflies ? .

John McCain needs what Kinky Friedman calls `` a checkup from the neck up . '' . <eos> In choosing Alaska Gov . <eos> Sarah Palin to be his running mate , he is not thinking `` outside the box , '' as some have said . <eos> More like out of his mind . <eos> Palin a first-term governor of a state with more reindeer than people , will have to put on a few pounds just to be a lightweight . <eos> Her personal story is impressive : former fisherman , mother of five . <eos> But that hardly qualifies her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency . <eos> For a man who is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible . <eos> Suddenly , McCain 's age and health become central issues in the campaign , as does his judgment . <eos> In choosing this featherweight , McCain passed over Tom Ridge , a decorated combat hero , a Cabinet secretary and the former two-term governor of the large , complex state of Pennsylvania . <eos> iReport.com : 'McCain pick might be a gimmick ' He passed over Mitt Romney , who ran a big state , Massachusetts ; a big company , Bain Capital ; and a big event , the Olympics . <eos> He passed over Kay Bailey Hutchison , the Texas senator who is knowledgeable about the military , good on television and -- obviously -- a woman . <eos> He passed over Joe Lieberman , his best friend in the Senate and fellow Iraq Kool-Aid drinker . <eos> He passed over former congressman , trade negotiator and budget director Rob Portman . <eos> And he also passed over Mike Huckabee , the governor of Arkansas . <eos> For months , the McCainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience . <eos> In his first presidential decision , John McCain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country , potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful , complicated , difficult job in human history .
Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet . <eos> One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away , text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died . <eos> I was in New York , and friends and colleagues from Chicago , Illinois , to Dallas , Texas , and Los Angeles , California , were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead . <eos> The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead , which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times . <eos> What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth , and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition . <eos> Then there is the `` rumor '' of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards . <eos> The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging . <eos> Ultimately , a source came forward and was­ likely paid for the information ­that blew the lid off of the story ; the tabloid 's editor said `` you can assume '' the Enquirer paid for it . <eos> The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened . <eos> There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet was n't able to verify the story and run with it . <eos> The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS ' `` NewsHour with Jim Lehrer '' that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself , `` When rumor arises , we 're going to need to address it . <eos> And , unfortunately , we may need to address it before we can determine whether it 's true or not because it 's having impact , as it was in this case . '' . <eos> Sorry , Rick , I disagree . <eos> The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we do n't traffic in rumor and innuendo . <eos> None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control . <eos> Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications . <eos> Just check out this month 's Vanity Fair , where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns . <eos> The investment bank 's demise , some conclude , was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems , even though it was sitting on $ 18 billion . <eos> The rumors kept going and going­ and when the story hit the airwaves , it spread like wildfire . <eos> In one week , Bear Stearns was no more , and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth . <eos> We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story . <eos> The rules are simple : Either you have the facts or you do n't . <eos> If you do , you run with the story . <eos> If you do n't , you leave it alone . <eos> The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair . <eos> Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress . <eos> With other major media outlets turning up the heat , Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC 's Bob Woodruff . <eos> No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out , trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor . <eos> If they had , and the facts did n't support the rumor , then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more . <eos> We have an obligation to stick with the facts , and nothing else . <eos> And no matter what a blogger , Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with , the day we choose to alter our standards , our credibility and integrity will be shot . <eos> In the end , as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988 , that 's all we 've got . <eos> Nothing is worth losing that , even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over . <eos> Roland S.

With the political season in full swing , much is at stake for America . <eos> The economy is in a downward spiral . <eos> We have an energy crisis . <eos> Our jobless rate is on the rise . <eos> These are the subjects that generate headlines and much debate among the candidates . <eos> But there is an underlying problem that we as a nation have not addressed , a situation that should concern any American with an eye on the future , regardless of party affiliation . <eos> It is the crisis affecting our children : . <eos> • Nearly 30 percent of this year 's freshman class will drop out of high school , according to the National Center for Education Statistics . <eos> That number jumps to 40 percent in some urban areas . <eos> • The obesity rate for our kids has gone up by as much as 300 percent since 1980 , according to the National Center for Health Statistics , triggering a host of health-related problems , from diabetes to heart disease . <eos> • Young people account for more than 20 percent of violent crimes in the United States , according to statistics cited by Duke University 's Center for Child and Family Policy . <eos> Violent juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 4 p.m. , at the end of the school day . <eos> These facts are grim enough . <eos> Factor in persistent patterns of poverty , gang activity , drug abuse and teenage pregnancy , and you have a generation of Americans that will be unprepared -- indeed , unable -- to meet the challenges posed by a complex world . <eos> We expect our leaders to lead . <eos> But as citizens , we should n't simply sit back and hope that politicians stand up to the test . <eos> We can participate in the political process , advocating for policies that will benefit the health , education and well-being of young Americans , because we must do a better job of preparing our youth to lead . <eos> It is daunting to think about solving such a widespread crisis . <eos> But there are youth-serving organizations that can and do play a key role in effecting positive change -- places such as Boys & Girls Clubs , with a long track record of helping young people turn things around , get an education , lead healthy lives and become effective leaders . <eos> I know , because I was one of those kids . <eos> Club staff taught me right from wrong and made the lesson stick . <eos> They planted the seeds early on that led me to envision myself as a high school graduate , a college graduate and an achiever in whatever field I chose . <eos> Boys & Girls Clubs do this today for millions of kids , offering everything from homework help to career exploration , performing a daily miracle that turns hope into opportunity . <eos> Urging children and the adults in their lives to `` Be Great , '' these clubs communicate the idea that there is potential for greatness in every child . <eos> This powerful call to action reminds us that we can all play a role in helping youth realize their dreams . <eos> So I ask you to join me in this effort . <eos> There are many ways to help : . <eos> • Volunteering at a local youth organization . <eos> • Leading by example . <eos> • Donating to charities that make a difference . <eos> In partnership with government , schools , community leaders and parents , we can create a network and culture in which everyone embraces the importance of a positive future for our youth . <eos> But right now , with Election Day fast approaching , ask your local , state and national candidates what they are doing to help our young people become tomorrow 's leaders . <eos> Ask them to make children a top priority and tell them that you hold them accountable . <eos> If we all become advocates for our children , elected officials might just take action . <eos> We can do better . <eos> And if we care about our nation 's future , we must do better .
One of the most intriguing conversations I had at either the Democratic or Republican convention was with a white labor leader from Ohio . <eos> I ca n't remember his name , but he made it clear that he is going all around the Rust Belt state looking his white union brothers and sisters in the eye and essentially shaming them into supporting Sen. Barack Obama for president . <eos> No , he 's not saying vote for the black man for president because he 's black . <eos> He said he 's telling them that it 's shameful that as Democrats , they agree with him on various political issues , but because of his skin color , they are refusing to cast ballots for him . <eos> `` We have gone to our black brothers and sisters for years to support our [ white ] candidates , and it 's wrong for us to stand here and not support one of their own , even though we 're Democrats , '' he barked . <eos> There is nothing more in-your-face than to hear someone speak truthfully to the inherent racism that is at play in this election . <eos> For all the talk about inclusion and the historic nature of this campaign , the true tribal feelings of so many people will come into play , whether we want to admit it or not . <eos> We are seeing remarkable bias playing strongly in this election . <eos> Exit-polling data in the primaries showed some evidence of bias when it came to age , race and gender , but the great concern is whether people are as honest in talking to pollsters as they are in the voting booth . <eos> Because Sen. John McCain is 72 and would be the oldest person to be sworn in as president , there is a lot of dialogue about how old this white guy is , and how wrong it is that he 's running . <eos> Age questions also have been raised about the 47-year-old black guy from Chicago and whether he is too young and inexperienced to lead . <eos> While there is a lot of talk and excitement surrounding Alaska Gov . <eos> Sarah Palin being named as the first woman on a Republican ticket , and what that may mean in terms of widespread female support coming the way of McCain-Palin , there are some voices who refuse to vote for a woman . <eos> We 've also seen a number of prominent women -- including Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn and radio talk show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger -- who have questioned whether the 44-year-old white mother of five children should be vice president , considering she has five children , including a special needs child . <eos> It 's wonderful to talk about the economy , immigration , the war in Iraq , health care and education , but we ca n't be naïve to the reality that when voters go into that voting booth , they will , as one person told me during an interview , `` vote with their tribe . '' . <eos> That was one of the arguments we heard during the Democratic primaries when Obama enjoyed overwhelming support from African-Americans -- to the tune of 90-plus percent -- while Sen. Hillary Clinton had major female support , largely white , in the range of 65 to 70 percent . <eos> So what do we do when it comes to our tendency to follow group identification ? . <eos> 1 . <eos> Stop dancing around the topic . <eos> When you watch TV and hear folks talk about Wal-Mart moms or small , rural towns , they are talking about white Americans . <eos> These catch phrases never include African-Americans or Hispanics . <eos> 2 . <eos> Confront bias where it is . <eos> Ask your friends , neighbors , co-workers and church members who they are voting for . <eos> When they give you the `` I really ca n't put my finger on it '' line , then press them . <eos> Hard . <eos> You know the real answer , so do n't beat around the bush . <eos> The best folks to challenge Americans on their hang-ups regarding age , race and gender are n't the AARP , NAACP or NOW . <eos> It 's Y-O-U . <eos> Do n't give in to the `` That 's the way I was raised '' mantra . <eos> When someone suggests that flags and faith show that a candidate is n't one of us , drill down . <eos> 3 . <eos> Accept the fact that some people will not change . <eos> We all think that we have been gifted to the degree that our sane and logical arguments can get folks off their biased stumps . <eos> Some people just wo n't give in . <eos> Fine , move on . <eos> The goal is to rid our society of as much bias as possible . <eos> If someone is so hard-headed , then you have to go on to the next person and try to change them . <eos> It 's critical that we be as honest as possible about the impact of race , age and gender in campaigns . <eos> A lot of people love to toss around the Rev . <eos> Martin Luther King Jr. 's quote that he hoped one day people would be judged by `` the content of their character . '' . <eos> But it 's still a reality that skin tone , gender and our birth date means more than character to a lot of Americans .
Campaigns are ugly . <eos> Watching the way politicians act makes you long for the respect and self-control of the Sopranos . <eos> Throughout , there are legitimate attacks and outright lies . <eos> Every once in a while , I get a call on my radio show from someone telling me that Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim , who admitted it in an interview with George Stephanopoulos , and has a fake birth certificate . <eos> No , no , and no . <eos> As I tell them , there are legitimate reasons not to vote for Barack Obama , no need to make them up . <eos> But the newest target is Sarah Palin . <eos> Let 's take a quick look at just a fraction of what she has faced in her first few days as John McCain 's choice for vice president . <eos> iReport.com : Do you think Palin is being treated unfairly ? . <eos> `` Sarah Palin believes God told her to go to war with Iraq ! '' . <eos> There has been some hard-core journalistic malpractice on this one . <eos> The Associated Press ran this headline about a speech she gave at her church : `` Palin : Iraq war ' a task that is from God ' '' In the story , they omit the first part of the sentence they 're quoting along with the entire previous sentence for good measure . <eos> Here are her actual words : `` Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right . <eos> Also , for this country , that our leaders , our national leaders , are sending them out on a task that is from God . <eos> That 's what we have to make sure that we 're praying for , that there is a plan and that that plan is God 's plan . '' . <eos> Palin is clearly praying that we 're doing the right thing in Iraq , something sensible for an introspective woman of faith concerned about the lives of our troops to do . <eos> She 's not saying that she just received a text message from heaven 's BlackBerry ordering her to launch missiles . <eos> Sorry to disappoint you . <eos> And for those of you who think politicians asking God for guidance is offensive , might I remind you of this famous politician 's prayer : . <eos> `` Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just . <eos> And make me an instrument of your will . '' . <eos> -- Barack Obama . <eos> `` She has no experience ! '' . <eos> It 's fair to assume that Barack Obama believed he was qualified to be in the White House when he announced he was running for president . <eos> At that point , he had been a U.S . <eos> Senator for 767 days . <eos> When Sarah Palin was announced as a vice presidential candidate , she had been the governor of Alaska for 634 days . <eos> While I 'm sure those extra 133 days were filled with personal discovery , I ca n't imagine anyone seriously trying to make the case that Obama is experienced and Palin is n't . <eos> Unless , of course , you 're Matt Damon , who said a Palin presidency would be a really `` scary thing '' because she has been `` governor of Alaska for ... for less than two years ! '' . <eos> ( Damon originally expressed his presidential preference for Obama in December 2006 , when he had been a senator for less than two years . ) . <eos> More importantly , Palin 's career has been filled with executive experience . <eos> She 's the only one of the four in this race who has run a business , town , and/or state ( a state that gives her crucial energy experience in the middle of an energy crisis ) . <eos> When Obama 's campaign complains that Palin would be one heartbeat away from the presidency , they should consider that their candidate would be zero heartbeats away . <eos> `` But Obama is running a huge campaign -- Palin was just a small town mayor ! '' . <eos> Believe it or not , this one was actually trotted out by Obama himself . <eos> `` My understanding is , is that Gov . <eos> Palin 's town of Wasilla has , I think , 50 employees . <eos> We 've got 2,500 in this campaign . <eos> I think the budget is maybe $ 12 million a year . <eos> We have a budget of about three times that just for the month . '' . <eos> Apparently , Barack missed that she 's become the governor of Alaska in the interim . <eos> Why would he compare his current duties with her former duties ? . <eos> Well , since he announced his candidacy , Barack Obama has raised about $ 22 million a month . <eos> That 's a large organization for sure , unless you are directly comparing it to Sarah Palin , who is handling state revenues that are about 61 times as large , or more than $ 1.3 billion per month . <eos> `` Palin only supports abstinence to be taught in sex-ed ! '' . <eos> This claim is usually followed by a super classy comment about her daughter and the use of contraception , but the premise is false . <eos> Palin has n't said she does n't want condoms discussed in sex-ed , calling their discussion `` relatively benign . '' . <eos> `` I 'm pro-contraception , and I think kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues . <eos> So I am not anti-contraception . <eos> But , yeah , abstinence is another alternative that should be discussed with kids . <eos> I do n't have a problem with that , '' Palin said . <eos> Hers is hardly an extreme point of view in America today . <eos> `` If she cares about children with special needs , then why did she cut spending on them by 62 percent ? '' . <eos> Actually , Palin almost tripled their funding in only three years from $ 26,900 per student to $ 73,840 per student . <eos> Incidentally , the amount of government money you spend on a specific group does n't equal the amount you care for that group , but that 's another story for another column . <eos> All of these represent just a small percentage of the bizarre collection of claims being thrown at Palin by her opponents and some in the media -- who are desperately hoping something will stick . <eos> I leave you with my favorite so far : The Internet rumors that she harbors racism against Eskimos . <eos> If true , she sure has a strange way of expressing it -- her husband , Todd , is half Yupik Inuit Eskimo . <eos> To balance that out , she must really love his other half .
`` Greed is good . '' . <eos> At least , that 's what Michael Douglas ' character Gordon Gekko claimed in the movie Wall Street . <eos> But , just like Gekko , the modern-day companies that followed that motto now find themselves wondering how everything could collapse so fast . <eos> You know the names by now : Countrywide Financial , Bear Stearns , IndyMac , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers , AIG . <eos> And that 's not even counting companies like Citigroup , Merrill Lynch , and Goldman Sachs that , while still in existence , have lost untold billions in market value and have laid off thousands of employees . <eos> Maybe greed is n't so good after all . <eos> Lehman was founded in 1844 when Henry Lehman , a German immigrant , opened a small shop in Montgomery , Alabama . <eos> His brothers joined him six years later and , by 1858 they were busy turning cotton provided by local farmers into a cash crop -- a business that did n't have anything to do with helping low-income families afford 27-bedroom McMansions . <eos> More than 150 years later , after surviving the Great Depression , Black Monday , the savings and loan crisis and the dot-com bust , Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection . <eos> They had gone 14 years as a public company without ever reporting a single quarterly loss . <eos> Now they will never again post a profit . <eos> Bear Stearns ' story is eerily similar . <eos> Founded in 1923 . <eos> Survived every crisis . <eos> Never posted a quarterly loss until last year . <eos> Gone without a trace . <eos> So how did 235 years of rock-solid American finance disappear virtually overnight ? . <eos> Well , it 's not as complicated as you think . <eos> If you replace all of the acronyms invented by the brainiacs on Wall Street with references to things that Main Street understands , it becomes a lot easier to see how it all happened . <eos> Here 's a quick story I invented that does just that . <eos> ( Note to any Wall Street executives who might be reading this : I know this simple little story is n't perfect , but let 's remember that you 're the ones who tried to make everything complicated and I 'm the one who still has a job . ) . <eos> It 's just before Christmas,1996 , and as you watch overeager parents trample each other to buy Tickle Me Elmo dolls for their kids , you see an opportunity . <eos> `` This is n't a Tickle Me Elmo bubble , '' you think to yourself , `` this is a long-term trend . <eos> Every person in America will soon own a Tickle Me Elmo , maybe even two . <eos> It 's the American dream . '' . <eos> You approach your local banker about a loan and , naturally , he loves your idea . <eos> In fact , he loves it so much that for every $ 1 you have in your account , he 's willing to lend you $ 34 . <eos> Great deal , you think , as you max out your credit line and buy as many Tickle Me Elmos as you possibly can . <eos> Sales are easy at first . <eos> People are lining up to buy your dolls and the prices are going far higher than you ever thought . <eos> The only person happier than you is your banker . <eos> But the following year something unexpected happens : Kids stop asking for Tickle Me Elmos . <eos> You try to cut the price , but no buyers show up . <eos> You cut the price more , but your store remains empty . <eos> Panic sets in . <eos> You 're pretty sure that this downturn is just temporary ( after all , who would n't want a Tickle Me Elmo ? ) . <eos> but you 're quickly running out of cash . <eos> Your only option is to buy time and hope that Tickle Me Elmos start flying off your shelves again . <eos> You visit every bank in town and , using your piles of Tickle Me Elmo dolls as collateral ( which , of course , you purchased with money you did n't have ) you get as much new capital as possible . <eos> Soon that money is also gone . <eos> Even your friends and family refuse to give you any more loans . <eos> At the end of your rope , you go to your town council , which gives you a `` bridge loan '' to get you through the next few months ( something that makes your Furby-selling competitors extremely upset ) . <eos> Unfortunately , no matter how much you borrow , there 's still one nagging little problem : No one wants to buy your stupid Tickle Me Elmo dolls anymore . <eos> The longer you wait , the less they 're worth . <eos> You sell some for pennies on the dollar , but pretty soon you ca n't even do that . <eos> Then things get even worse : News breaks that China is poisoning some Tickle Me Elmos before shipping them to the United States . <eos> Now your dolls are not just out of favor , they 're toxic . <eos> You literally ca n't even give them away . <eos> Soon the rest of your money dries up , as do the people who are willing to lend you any more of it . <eos> Now you 're out of cash ; out of a job , and , if not for the pile of poisonous Tickle Me Elmo dolls in your basement , completely alone -- which sounds kind of like the CEOs of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns . <eos> Believe it or not , this ridiculous story may be far from reality , but it 's not that far off from describing what these financial and mortgage companies did to themselves . <eos> Just replace the Tickle Me Elmo references with the once popular , then discounted , now completely toxic subprime mortgages and you 're pretty much there . <eos> When you cut through all the noise about `` bridge loans '' and `` discount windows , '' what you 're left with is the fact that too many companies still own way too many Tickle Me Elmos that no one wants to buy . <eos> Giving those companies more money does n't solve anything , it just buys time . <eos> Unless and until the underlying problem is fixed , no real turnaround can happen . <eos> But we all know that investors ( and elected leaders worried about their careers this November ) are n't all that patient . <eos> That 's why the new chorus you 're likely to soon hear will be from people arguing that the only way out of this mess is for the federal government to step in and purchase all of the toxic mortgages themselves . <eos> That would allow the companies with eyes bigger than their balance sheets to start over , with barely any repercussions whatsoever and without ever taking responsibility for their mistakes . <eos> Come to think of it , maybe greed is n't so bad after all . <eos> Would the government actually consider that idea ? . <eos> They already are . <eos> In fact , the only thing stopping politicians from `` rewarding '' us with a new government agency that will put billions more of our tax dollars at stake is , ironically enough , the election of new politicians . <eos> Disclaimer : Tickle Me Elmo is still an extremely popular , non-toxic product and , to the best of my knowledge , is not responsible for the credit crisis .
Do you know what was so great about Magic Johnson , Larry Bird and Michael Jordan ? . <eos> They were three of the biggest trash talkers in the history of the NBA , but they had the game to back it up . <eos> Somebody should tell that to Gov . <eos> Sarah Palin . <eos> Sen. John McCain 's vice presidential running mate has been running around the country , firing up her -- yes , her , and not necessarily McCain 's -- loyal supporters by blasting Sen. Barack Obama for `` palling around with terrorists '' and demanding that the American people know exactly when he learned of the past of 1960s radical William Ayers . <eos> She has stoked the crowds by saying , `` This is not a man who sees America the way that you and I see America . '' . <eos> We all know what that is designed to do : Portray Obama as a foreigner who is n't as American as she . <eos> Or you . <eos> Or Joe Six-pack , the hockey mom , soccer mom , Wal-Mart mom , NASCAR dad and the other coded words she uses regularly . <eos> But what is truly pathetic is that Palin talks tough , but is really scared of facing her own issues . <eos> Since she is good at proclaiming that the American people need to know who Barack Obama is -- an attempt to paint him as a shady figure who might occupy the White House -- the American people deserve to hear Palin answer if her husband , Todd , a former member of the Alaska Independence Party , agreed with its founder , who wanted to secede from the union . <eos> Is there anything more anti-American than wanting to sever ties with the country ? . <eos> Send Roland Martin your questions and listen to his program on CNNRadio and CNN.com Live , Thursday at noon ET . <eos> It 's critical that Palin answer questions about whether she disagrees with John McCain 's criticism of the Bush administration 's decision to remove North Korea from the terrorist nation list . <eos> She spoke in favor of it . <eos> McCain did n't . <eos> Are they on the same page or not ? . <eos> The American people deserve to hear from Palin as to why she did n't say a word to rebuke the hateful , pathetic and degrading comments made at rallies featuring her , such as when someone in the crowd called Obama a terrorist , someone else shouted , `` Off with his head '' and others suggested he is a traitor . <eos> Lastly , do n't you think the self-described maverick needs to own up to what really happened with the firing of the commissioner in Alaska ? . <eos> She was declared by a special investigator to have been within her rights in firing the commissioner , but she was blasted for abuse of power and violating the state 's ethics act . <eos> So what did she say in a conference call with Alaska reporters -- who were not allowed by the McCain camp to ask follow-up questions ? . <eos> That she was cleared of all wrongdoing , legally and ethically . <eos> That 's right . <eos> She repeated over and over and over an absolute lie , and we are supposed to say , `` Hey , it 's all fine . <eos> She winks at us . <eos> We love her hockey mom schtick . <eos> Do n't worry about that abuse of power thing . '' . <eos> Well , after having to deal with Vice President Dick Cheney being accused of beating the drum for war by berating and pushing our intelligence apparatus to match his political views on Iraq , do n't you think we should really care about someone who has been accused in a report , authorized by Democrats and Republicans , of using their power and influence to get their way ? . <eos> Sure , her supporters will say she 's talked to the `` media . '' . <eos> She was questioned by Laura Ingraham , Rush Limbaugh and that self-described journalist -- yes , he really called himself that -- Fox 's Sean Hannity . <eos> Palin has done interviews with ABC 's Charlie Gibson and CBS 's Katie Couric , and local TV folks . <eos> But why is she so scared of NBC 's Brian Williams ? . <eos> And why is she so fearful of CNN ? . <eos> Does she somehow think that our big guns like Wolf Blitzer , Anderson Cooper and Campbell Brown are just too tough in asking questions ? . <eos> My goodness , Tina Fey has actually done more interviews about playing Sarah Palin than Sarah Palin has done about being Sarah Palin ! . <eos> Hmmm . <eos> McCain , Sen. Joe Biden , Barack and Michelle Obama , Sen. Hillary Clinton , Cindy McCain and even McCain 's 95-year-old momma and Palin 's daddy have all done interviews with CNN , sharing their thoughts on the campaign . <eos> But Palin ? . <eos> Not a whisper . <eos> It 's clear that Palin really is n't a true frontier woman . <eos> See , when you tote a gun , carry a big stick and spit fire , you are n't afraid to take on all comers . <eos> So , Sarah , if you want to talk big on the campaign trail to those audiences that do n't talk back , go right ahead . <eos> But if you truly are the maverick politician you say you are , come on and talk to us soft , coddled , elitist journalists . <eos> Surely we are n't as tough as the moose you like to take down with your Second Amendment-protected hunting rifle .
A recent controversy at Baylor University has brought new attention to the widespread misuse of standardized college admission tests to rank the quality of America 's colleges and universities . <eos> The SAT and ACT have achieved nearly iconic status in America and throughout the world . <eos> As the late author and scholar Stephen Jay Gould noted , the tests are viewed by many as `` abstruse and mysterious , '' with powerful effects on public policy , social mobility , and even individual identity . <eos> Misuse of test scores as college ranking criteria creates undue pressure on admission offices to pursue increasingly high test scores and fuels the tests ' disproportionate influence . <eos> Last June , Baylor University encouraged its already admitted first-year students to retake the SAT . <eos> The reward for students who retook the test was $ 300 in bookstore credits . <eos> Students who increased their score by more than 50 points got a $ 1,000 merit aid scholarship . <eos> If enough students retook the SAT and increased their scores , the gains might be enough to move Baylor up the rankings list . <eos> The scarce financial resources allocated for this plan are too badly needed elsewhere , particularly among low-income students in rural and urban areas around the country , to spend on an effort to raise a college 's SAT profile . <eos> A Baylor spokesman told The Associated Press Thursday that the university `` goofed '' and would likely end the incentives . <eos> It 's critical to understand that high SAT and ACT scores alone do not equate to merit . <eos> Last month , our organization 's Commission on the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission issued a report calling for change in the way everyone involved in college admissions uses the tests . <eos> Test misuses feed the public perception that the scores are the most influential factor in college admission . <eos> For the past 15 years , National Association for College Admission Counseling ( NACAC ) research has shown that students ' grades in high school , particularly grades in college preparatory courses , are by far the most important consideration in college admission decisions . <eos> One of the most pressing problems regarding the SAT and ACT scores is their misuse in the U.S. News and World Report college rankings formula . <eos> The SAT and ACT were designed to provide information about a student to colleges and universities and were never meant to be measures of college quality . <eos> Accordingly , the commission encouraged U.S. News and World Report to eliminate test scores as a measure of institutional quality . <eos> The U.S. News ranking formula includes a `` student selectivity '' score that constitutes 15 percent of a college 's overall rank . <eos> SAT or ACT scores of enrollees make up 50 percent of the student selectivity score . <eos> In response to the NACAC report , U.S. News and World Report said , `` As long as standardized tests play an integral role in the college admissions process , U.S. News will use them as part of our ranking methodology . '' . <eos> The situation at Baylor is a reminder of the inflated value assigned to the SAT and ACT in higher education . <eos> The fervor surrounding the rankings , as well as the lengths to which colleges go to increase them , are unfortunate distractions in higher education and admissions . <eos> The impression students and families get from the rankings is that higher test scores mean higher quality colleges . <eos> To borrow a phrase familiar to admission deans , many colleges recruit great students and then graduate great students . <eos> Is that because of the institution , or the students ? . <eos> Some credit undoubtedly should go to both . <eos> But is a college of lower quality because its students ' SAT scores are lower than those of students at another college ? . <eos> Generally speaking , the ability of admission tests to predict success in higher education is much more limited than most people think . <eos> Colleges most often determine the utility of admission test scores by assessing how well they predict first-year grades . <eos> Colleges are wrong to place so much emphasis on test scores as measurements of their institutional worth when admission offices across the board consider the scores to be one among many indicators of a student 's merit . <eos> As influential as the rankings have been with students and families , is it any wonder that colleges whose stakeholders often demand higher ranks go to such lengths to influence their position in the rankings ? . <eos> Misuse of test scores has real ramifications for students and families . <eos> For every student able to afford test-performance tutoring and fees for taking the test many times , there are many qualified students from under-served backgrounds who become discouraged that they will be unable to compete . <eos> For every college that raises its SAT or ACT profile for rankings purposes , there are hundreds , if not thousands , of qualified students who will never apply because artificially inflated test scores signal yet another barrier to higher education . <eos> It is critical to re-evaluate the varied uses of admission tests , and protect against their misuse in all forms .
Make no mistake , Barack Obama is one cool customer . <eos> Now , after the last debate , it seems all but certain that the Iceman cometh to the White House . <eos> Radio talk show hosts and rank-and-file Republicans spent the last few weeks pleading with John McCain to take the gloves off and take the fight to Obama . <eos> How 's that working out , folks ? . <eos> In this week 's match-up , Obama snatched the gloves out of McCain 's hands and slapped him silly with them . <eos> I suppose the hope was that Obama would get rattled and make a mistake . <eos> But Obama does n't get rattled or make many mistakes . <eos> I still have no idea what type of president Obama would make . <eos> But he 's an extraordinary politician . <eos> In fact , he may even be better than Bill Clinton who , while he had the IQ and EQ , also had the burden of a legendary red-hot temper . <eos> Obviously , it takes a lot to get under Obama 's skin . <eos> McCain sure tried . <eos> Maybe this is the guy we want negotiating with world leaders . <eos> Maybe after eight years of George W. Bush stubbornness , on the heels of eight years of Clinton emotiveness , we need to send out for ice . <eos> In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll , 58 percent of those who watched the debate said Obama did the better job and 31 percent said that about McCain . <eos> That makes three skins for Obama . <eos> In earlier polls , 54 percent of those who watched thought Obama won the second debate , and 51 percent thought he won the first one . <eos> This week , McCain turned in his best performance of the debates , and the first 30 minutes -- with McCain bringing up Obama 's problematic encounter with the now famous Joe the Plumber ; and the quip about how he is n't Bush and how Obama should have run four years ago -- were near flawless for the Republican . <eos> iReport.com : Are you Joe the Plumber ? . <eos> Get out your plunger and share your thoughts . <eos> McCain put Obama on the defensive , and it showed . <eos> If McCain had been that aggressive throughout the first two debates -- firm but not necessary unlikable -- we might be looking at a different race right now . <eos> But , over the next hour , Obama regained his stride and eventually dominated the exchange . <eos> And , in the end , with his sarcastic crack about school vouchers -- `` Because there 's not enough vouchers ; therefore , we should n't do it , even though it 's working . <eos> I got it . '' . <eos> -- McCain was profoundly unlikable . <eos> So said the polls . <eos> In the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll , 70 percent of debate watchers found Obama more likable . <eos> Only 22 percent said that about McCain . <eos> McCain 's supporters wanted him to bring up some of the allegedly shady characters from Obama 's circle of acquaintances that give some Americans pause and lead them to question the Democrat 's values . <eos> There are good reasons to have that conversation , and bad ones . <eos> A friend and fellow journalist told me Obama 's Chicago posse was important because it formed `` the political womb where the fetal Obama grew into a politician . <eos> ... That tells us who he is and what either he believes himself or is at least willing to tolerate as president . '' . <eos> Frankly , that argument makes a lot more sense than what many of the Obama haters are saying about how these `` Friends of Barack '' prove he is a couple of flag pins short of being a full-blooded American . <eos> That 's nonsense . <eos> For instance , with William Ayers -- the unrepentant domestic terrorist who Obama first claimed was just a guy who lived in his neighborhood but with whom we now know the Illinois senator had a more substantial relationship -- the issue is n't Obama 's patriotism but his truthfulness . <eos> Still , it was obviously a mistake for McCain to bring up Ayers during the debate . <eos> The tactic backfired . <eos> In the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll , 62 percent of debate watchers said Obama 's connection to Ayers mattered to them `` not much '' or `` not at all . '' . <eos> Only 23 percent said it mattered `` a great deal . '' . <eos> McCain should leave it to the press to mine the question of whether Obama has been totally honest about his relationship with Ayers -- well , at least those in the press who have n't already sent in requests for tickets to the Barack Obama inaugural ball . <eos> As for McCain , he is an American hero who has given his life to public service , and the country is better for it . <eos> That record of service need not come to an end . <eos> He can still contribute and finish out his term in the Senate . <eos> But , unless the political wind changes -- and quickly -- a promotion to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue does n't appear to be in the cards .
Many seem taken aback by the depth and severity of the current financial turmoil . <eos> I was among several economists who saw it coming and warned about the risks . <eos> There is ample blame to be shared ; but the purpose of parsing out blame is to figure out how to make a recurrence less likely . <eos> President Bush famously said , a little while ago , that the problem is simple : Too many houses were built . <eos> Yes , but the answer is too simplistic : Why did that happen ? . <eos> One can say the Fed failed twice , both as a regulator and in the conduct of monetary policy . <eos> Its flood of liquidity ( money made available to borrow at low interest rates ) and lax regulations led to a housing bubble . <eos> When the bubble broke , the excessively leveraged loans made on the basis of overvalued assets went sour . <eos> For all the new-fangled financial instruments , this was just another one of those financial crises based on excess leverage , or borrowing , and a pyramid scheme . <eos> The new `` innovations '' simply hid the extent of systemic leverage and made the risks less transparent ; it is these innovations that have made this collapse so much more dramatic than earlier financial crises . <eos> But one needs to push further : Why did the Fed fail ? . <eos> First , key regulators like Alan Greenspan did n't really believe in regulation ; when the excesses of the financial system were noted , they called for self-regulation -- an oxymoron . <eos> Second , the macro-economy was in bad shape with the collapse of the tech bubble . <eos> The tax cut of 2001 was not designed to stimulate the economy but to give a largesse to the wealthy -- the group that had been doing so well over the last quarter-century . <eos> The coup d'grace was the Iraq War , which contributed to soaring oil prices . <eos> Money that used to be spent on American goods now got diverted abroad . <eos> The Fed took seriously its responsibility to keep the economy going . <eos> It did this by replacing the tech bubble with a new bubble , a housing bubble . <eos> Household savings plummeted to zero , to the lowest level since the Great Depression . <eos> It managed to sustain the economy , but the way it did it was shortsighted : America was living on borrowed money and borrowed time . <eos> Finally , at the center of blame must be the financial institutions themselves . <eos> They -- and even more their executives -- had incentives that were not well aligned with the needs of our economy and our society . <eos> They were amply rewarded , presumably for managing risk and allocating capital , which was supposed to improve the efficiency of the economy so much that it justified their generous compensation . <eos> But they misallocated capital ; they mismanaged risk -- they created risk . <eos> They did what their incentive structures were designed to do : focusing on short-term profits and encouraging excessive risk-taking . <eos> This is not the first crisis in our financial system , not the first time that those who believe in free and unregulated markets have come running to the government for bail-outs . <eos> There is a pattern here , one that suggests deep systemic problems -- and a variety of solutions : . <eos> 1 . <eos> We need first to correct incentives for executives , reducing the scope for conflicts of interest and improving shareholder information about dilution in share value as a result of stock options . <eos> We should mitigate the incentives for excessive risk-taking and the short-term focus that has so long prevailed , for instance , by requiring bonuses to be paid on the basis of , say , five-year returns , rather than annual returns . <eos> 2 . <eos> Secondly , we need to create a financial product safety commission , to make sure that products bought and sold by banks , pension funds , etc . <eos> are safe for `` human consumption . '' . <eos> Consenting adults should be given great freedom to do whatever they want , but that does not mean they should gamble with other people 's money . <eos> Some may worry that this may stifle innovation . <eos> But that may be a good thing considering the kind of innovation we had -- attempting to subvert accounting and regulations . <eos> What we need is more innovation addressing the needs of ordinary Americans , so they can stay in their homes when economic conditions change . <eos> 3 . <eos> We need to create a financial systems stability commission to take an overview of the entire financial system , recognizing the interrelations among the various parts , and to prevent the excessive systemic leveraging that we have just experienced . <eos> 4 . <eos> We need to impose other regulations to improve the safety and soundness of our financial system , such as `` speed bumps '' to limit borrowing . <eos> Historically , rapid expansion of lending has been responsible for a large fraction of crises and this crisis is no exception . <eos> 5 . <eos> We need better consumer protection laws , including laws that prevent predatory lending . <eos> 6 . <eos> We need better competition laws . <eos> The financial institutions have been able to prey on consumers through credit cards partly because of the absence of competition . <eos> But even more importantly , we should not be in situations where a firm is `` too big to fail . '' . <eos> If it is that big , it should be broken up . <eos> These reforms will not guarantee that we will not have another crisis . <eos> The ingenuity of those in the financial markets is impressive . <eos> Eventually , they will figure out how to circumvent whatever regulations are imposed . <eos> But these reforms will make another crisis of this kind less likely , and , should it occur , make it less severe than it otherwise would be .
Negative attacks are as American as apple pie . <eos> Since the early days of the republic , candidates attacked with a vigor that contemporary strategists would admire . <eos> In the 1800 presidential election , for example , Thomas Jefferson and John Adams criticized one another with a stunning ferocity on everything from foreign and domestic policy to private character and personal behavior . <eos> Later campaigns were n't much better . <eos> Critics of Andrew Jackson in 1836 accused him of murdering Indians . <eos> In 1884 , Grover Cleveland was ridiculed for fathering an illegitimate child . <eos> William Jennings Bryan was characterized as a dangerous radical in 1896 who would ruin the economy . <eos> Despite these historical precedents , the 2008 campaign has reached all-time lows in the use of misleading and inaccurate political appeals . <eos> Even Karl Rove , the architect of negative ads in previous campaigns , has complained about the tenor of this year 's campaign . <eos> John McCain broadcast an ad taking Barack Obama 's words out of context and suggesting Democrats were trying to compare GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to a pig . <eos> The McCain campaign ran another spot erroneously claiming Obama favored comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners . <eos> Democrats have not been above reproach either . <eos> After McCain secured the GOP nomination this spring , outside groups falsely claimed the Republican supported a 1,000-year war in Iraq and therefore was not worthy of the presidency . <eos> These misleading appeals suggest voters must remain vigilant about candidate , party , and group claims . <eos> Generally , the most misleading commercials have come from independent groups uncoordinated with the candidates . <eos> These organizations feel free to run emotional and inaccurate content designed to play on voter 's fears and anxieties . <eos> Some of the worst ads in recent memory , such as the Willie Horton ad in 1988 , have been broadcast by these kinds of groups . <eos> In past years , the only upside of attack ads was that they generally contained more issue content than other types of ads . <eos> Since reporters police campaign appeals , the ads generally stick to the issues and rely on factually-accurate information . <eos> Ad sponsors and candidates realize they will be held accountable for unfair ad content . <eos> However , commercials run this year represent a break with this general pattern . <eos> Attack ads broadcast in recent months have twisted the truth , lied about personal background , taken statements out of context , and clearly sought to manipulate voter sentiments . <eos> Most worrisome from a factual standpoint is McCain 's claim that Obama will raise taxes on the middle class . <eos> Although Obama has pledged to increase income taxes on those earning more than $ 250,000 , he has been careful not to make proposals that would raise taxes on the middle class for fear of being labeled a tax-and-spend liberal . <eos> McCain 's tax claims have been condemned by leading editorial boards and surely will attract considerable attention in upcoming debates . <eos> With all the factual inaccuracies that have taken place , voters need to protect themselves from efforts at political manipulation . <eos> Non-partisan Web sites such as www.factcheck.org represent one source of unbiased information . <eos> They analyze ads and compile factual information in support of or in opposition to ad claims . <eos> Other trustworthy fact-checkers include ad watches and reality checks run by leading news organizations . <eos> These features dissect candidate claims in regard to accuracy , strategy , and impact . <eos> But the best thing for voters to do is to watch the candidate debates and judge for themselves . <eos> Study the statements and the factual bases of policy claims . <eos> Pay attention to how the candidates speak and what they say . <eos> Find out what non-partisan groups think and see what they have to say regarding the major issues . <eos> By the time the campaign is over , the presidential candidates are expected to have spent 55 percent of their overall budget on ads . <eos> Strategists put together spots very carefully and pre-test major messages on small groups of voters . <eos> Most of this money will be devoted to television spots . <eos> But increasingly amounts are being targeted on radio , direct mail , and Internet appeals . <eos> In the end , voters are going to have to decipher competing charges and counter-charges amid considerable noise from all sides . <eos> The 2008 election is unusual in having so many big issues on the agenda : the economy , the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , health care , taxes , immigration , education and climate change . <eos> It is an election that truly matters because of the stark differences between the parties and the closeness of the campaign . <eos> Voters need to pay serious attention to the facts in order to make a wise choice .
In the 19 years that Teresa Hairston has published her magazine , GospelToday , she has never faced a major situation with Christian bookstores across the country that carry the publication . <eos> She 's tackled any number of issues over the years , and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers , ranging from Yolanda Adams to Bishop T.D . <eos> Jakes to Kirk Franklin . <eos> But when the Atlanta , Georgia , entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month , she says , Lifeway Christian Stores treated her like she had converted her Christian publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor Larry Flynt . <eos> Apparently , the owner of Lifeway , the Southern Baptist Convention , was n't too happy with Hairston telling the story of female pastors , because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor . <eos> According to Hairston , the Christian company did n't even give her the courtesy of a heads-up . <eos> `` We got an anonymous tip , '' she told me Tuesday on The Tom Joyner Morning Show , and after checking it out , she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of Lifeway 's 100-plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter . <eos> `` They have never called me , '' Hairston said . <eos> `` Never sent an e-mail . <eos> Nothing . <eos> I had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done . '' . <eos> The actions of Lifeway did n't stun me . <eos> I had seen this movie before . <eos> A few years ago , my wife was a longtime Lifeway teacher . <eos> She had taught at the company 's teaching centers for years , but then one day , she was notified that she would have to take down her Web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher . <eos> Her crime ? . <eos> Calling herself the Rev . <eos> Jacquie Hood Martin . <eos> It was n't that she did so for the heck of it . <eos> She graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary ; was the first female staff pastor at Houston 's Brookhollow Baptist Church/the Church Without Walls , a Southern Baptist Convention church ; and has been leading folks to the Lord all over the country for 20 years . <eos> She was angered by Lifeway 's decision but made it clear that she did n't serve the bookstore or even the Southern Baptist Convention . <eos> She made a commitment to serving Jesus Christ and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male-dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the Bible calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit . <eos> So she cut them off and kept on calling herself the Rev . <eos> Jacquie Hood Martin . <eos> Religious folks will quickly say that Scripture is clear that women ca n't be pastors and lead men , yet Hairston says that when she featured Pastor Paula White on her cover two years ago , Lifeway did n't take any action against the magazine . <eos> Anyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith 's writings , while others have a different interpretation . <eos> I 've heard Brookhollow 's pastor , the Rev . <eos> Dr. Ralph Douglas West Sr. , preach several sermons stating that what Paul wrote in 2 Timothy with regards to only men preaching was specific to that church and not a blanket ban . <eos> Second , there were instances where Paul wrote that his views were his own and not mandates from God . <eos> That is a doctrinal fight that any of us can have any time ( and I love it how these same Bible thumpers ignore the biblical story of Deborah , who was a judge in the Old Testament -- and was over men ) . <eos> But what is a greater issue is that Lifeway clearly has no respect for freedom of the press . <eos> Here is arguably the top Christian bookstore in the country making a decision based on their teachings and applying it to a magazine . <eos> A spokesman for Lifeway Resources , which runs the stores , was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week as saying of female pastors , `` It is contrary to what we believe . '' . <eos> So does Lifeway and , by extension , the Southern Baptist Convention , fight vigorously for freedom of religion , but it does n't give a hoot about the other freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution ? . <eos> I now wonder whether Lifeway makes it its business to cull through any number of magazines and search for stories that go against its doctrine and pull them from the shelves . <eos> This is the kind of nonsense that drives more people away from religion . <eos> I suppose it 's fitting that this story would come out the same time as Bill Maher releases his religious documentary , `` Religulous , '' which skewers all the major religions for their dogma . <eos> I 'm sure he feasted on positions of the Southern Baptist Convention . <eos> The conduct of Lifeway and the Southern Baptist Convention is shameful , and they owe Hairston an apology for their actions . <eos> Yet she 's taken it in stride , saying that instead of giving the company hell , she 'll `` give them heaven . '' . <eos> I say , give them a lot of hell for this , because they deserve it for actions .
Dear America : . <eos> Happy 300th Birthday ! . <eos> It 's 2076 and we 've just invented the time-fax machine . <eos> ( Actually , `` we '' did n't invent the time-fax machine , the State did -- they pretty much control everything now . ) . <eos> I 'm faxing this back to you in 2008 because that seems to be the year we had the best chance to reverse our course and get back to the vision laid out by our founding fathers -- a vision that did n't include the government being in the insurance business . <eos> I do n't have a lot of time ( the State only gives us one 30-minute break per day ) so let me give you some advice : Stop worrying so much about who runs the country and start worrying about who runs your towns , your states , and your Congress . <eos> I know you 're all distracted by the presidential election , but for all the money and time poured into it , the truth is that you 're choosing between two roads that will lead you to the same destination . <eos> Sure , one may be the Autobahn and the other a two-lane highway , but you 'll end up at the same place either way . <eos> Decades of Republicans and Democrats alike have all chipped in to lead you to where you are today . <eos> Believing that one person , from either party , can change that by themselves is a big mistake . <eos> Presidents are like captains of a large ship : They can map out a course and shout out orders , but without the trust and hard work of the people who actually move the rudders , their commands mean nothing . <eos> In retrospect , the lack of trust and confidence you now have in your leaders was really the root cause of everything that 's happened since . <eos> While our founding fathers designed a brilliant system of checks and balances , separation of powers and democratic elections , trust was the one thing they could n't mandate in the Constitution . <eos> Unfortunately , it 's also the foundation upon which everything else is built and once it began to erode , our whole house inevitably began to crumble . <eos> Looking back now , it 's pretty obvious that our trust in government declined at about the same rate as our partisanship increased . <eos> People became so concerned about getting their party into power at any cost that the truth did n't even seem to matter anymore . <eos> That 's probably one of the reasons why George Washington hated the idea of political parties so much . <eos> Here 's what he said about them in his 1796 farewell speech : . <eos> `` The alternate domination of one faction over another , sharpened by the spirit of revenge , natural to party dissension , which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities , is itself a frightful despotism . <eos> But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism . <eos> The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual ; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction , more able or more fortunate than his competitors , turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation , on the ruins of public liberty . '' . <eos> I know that George had a habit for using big words , so allow me to translate into 2008 English : Political parties that put their own success over that of the country 's will be the death of America . <eos> If you do n't believe him yet , just wait a few more years ... you 're about to see firsthand how right he was . <eos> After all , if power corrupts , then the kind of absolute power gained by political parties ( and feared by Washington ) corrupts absolutely . <eos> The best advice I can give you is to stop thinking in terms of left and right and start thinking in terms of right and wrong . <eos> Demand the best leaders possible , and then demand the best out of them . <eos> Believe me , when you see what 's coming your way , you 'll realize how little the donkey and the elephant really ever mattered . <eos> Oh and while we 're on politics , one quick thing that I 'm sure you 're curious about : Yes , Robert Byrd is still in the Senate . <eos> He 's 159 , but does n't look a day over 91 . <eos> Now , let 's talk about the economy . <eos> Let me see if I have this right : Money and power made people greedy , so you decided to hand over a bunch of money and power to greedy politicians instead . <eos> Smart ! . <eos> After using that money to nationalize a bunch of banks , mortgage companies and insurance companies , they moved on to bigger things . <eos> The airlines came first -- we just could n't live without them . <eos> Then it was the automakers ( Detroit would 've died ) , health care ( they said they could manage it better ) , and eventually , the oil companies ( I 'm not sure where all of those `` windfall profits '' have gone ) . <eos> The idea behind it all ( an idea that was eventually turned into law with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 2011 ) was to `` socialize losses '' by spreading them out among all taxpayers . <eos> The pain , our leaders argued , would be minimal that way . <eos> They were right . <eos> At least until the bills came due . <eos> See , we did n't actually have any of the money we were promising everyone ; we were borrowing it . <eos> It did n't take long before so many of our tax dollars were going toward interest payments that we could n't fund even the most basic of government programs without massive tax increases on everyone . <eos> People now work most of the year just to pay Uncle Sam ( or , as we now call him , `` Comrade Sam '' ) . <eos> I hear the State censors coming , so let me leave you with a few other quick things : . <eos> • Good call on not worrying about protecting our borders . <eos> That works out really well for you in 2019 . <eos> • You might want to spend a little less time worrying about carbon and a little more time worrying about Iran . <eos> We 're now in a new mini-Ice Age but , believe me , Iran is n't using their nukes to warm any homes . <eos> ( PS The International Atomic Energy Agency just revealed to you that Iran appears to be refitting their long-range missiles to carry nuclear payloads . <eos> Did you think they were joking or were you just too busy with lipsticks and pigs to notice ? ) . <eos> • The currency of the future is energy . <eos> Those who have it are thriving and those who do n't -- well , let 's just leave it at that . <eos> Drill for all the oil you can , but you also better start seriously looking for some other options . <eos> In closing , remember this golden rule and you should be fine : Your Constitution will never fail you , but your leaders will . <eos> Be wary of anyone who tries to convince you that it 's the other way around . <eos> Best wishes ( you 're going to need them ) , . <eos> Worker 2744A . <eos> PS It 's not all socialist doom and gloom here in the future . <eos> We just thawed Ted Williams ' cryogenically frozen body and he hit 87 home runs for the North Team ! .
If you think African-Americans will come out in greater numbers than ever before to vote for Barack Obama , you 're probably right . <eos> If you think you know how they 'll vote in the almost 500 House , Senate and gubernatorial races , you could be in for a surprise . <eos> Although politicians and their advertising gurus often speak to Black America as a collective , homogeneous group , the black population is anything but a monolith . <eos> In the past decade , the more than 40 million strong black population in America has become increasingly diverse : economically , socially , technologically and even philosophically . <eos> In the final push toward Election Day , as politicians and political hopefuls seek to penetrate this community , they may no longer understand to whom they are speaking . <eos> Are they addressing blacks or African-Americans ? . <eos> Is racial prejudice as important an issue today as affording a college education for their kids or taking care of an aging parent ? . <eos> iReport.com : Black college cancels class to vote . <eos> Radio One , the country 's largest broadcasting company primarily targeting African-Americans , recently commissioned a study to uncover Black America today . <eos> How do they identify themselves ? . <eos> What do they care about ? . <eos> How are they influenced ? . <eos> What is most important to them ? . <eos> Interestingly , the study found that 42 percent of those polled actually prefer to be called black ( these are more likely to be more affluent ) compared with 44 percent who choose to be described as African-American . <eos> And yes , it would be misguided to assume that dropping a Martin Luther King Jr. quote into a speech and focusing on America 's history of racial inequality is the sure way to sway black voters when one-third of blacks , particularly younger people , believe that there is actually too much focus on past oppression . <eos> And as insulting as it is to assume that all women vote for female candidates , it is equally inaccurate and offensive to say that blacks simply cast their ballots for people of color . <eos> Like all Americans , black folks vote on the issues they care about , and today those issues are less likely to be linked to race than they are to the economy , health care , education and a whole spectrum of social issues . <eos> As Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson recently said , `` black people do n't vote for candidates just because they are black . <eos> If Clarence Thomas ran for president , he would get five black votes . '' . <eos> Given Black America 's extreme diversity today ( the study identified 11 specific groups ) it is easy to misunderstand who they are and how they can be reached . <eos> Yes , discrimination and racial issues are still incredibly important , particularly to middle-age and older blacks . <eos> But the younger populations are more concerned about starting their own businesses , paying for their education , taking care of their children and creating a better work/life balance . <eos> So how do politicians penetrate the multiple segments of Black America ? . <eos> In 1992 , when Bill Clinton wooed African-Americans in church , he understood how to effectively reach that population . <eos> But that was before social networking sites attracted millions of teenage and young black adults . <eos> Now that the digital divide has faded , with roughly the same percentage of blacks online as the general population , ignoring black Web sites and social networking sites would be a big mistake . <eos> Although the history of black oppression in America is not the radioactive issue it once was , trust in the community -- whom blacks trust -- is still paramount . <eos> Of all institutions , they are least likely to trust credit card companies but also remain seriously wary of the mainstream media and tend to trust black media more than traditional media outlets . <eos> It has been almost a century and a half since blacks in America won the right to vote . <eos> It makes all the sense in the world that the black community has evolved and diversified over the years , but too often politicians make the mistake of assuming that blacks are still a monolithic group fixated on all of the same issues . <eos> Though Barack Obama will be able to count on a massive percentage of the black vote on Election Day , the rest of the ticket will need to dig deeper than the canned speeches dealing with racial injustice of the past to satisfy today 's black voters .
It has been heartening to witness the outpouring of worldwide enthusiasm over the election of Barack Obama as the next president of the United States , a transformational moment for our country . <eos> Our incoming president has huge challenges ahead of him , and he will undoubtedly reach out to other world leaders to help address the most difficult problems . <eos> A high priority will be the restoration of human rights , which have been badly eroded in recent years . <eos> President-elect Obama has reiterated his decision to close Guantánamo Bay detention center and end U.S.-sponsored torture . <eos> Also under discussion is the establishment by the U.S. government of an independent commission to examine the actions that led to these shameful policies and practices . <eos> Together , these steps would signal a renewed commitment to the cause of universal human rights long championed by the United States . <eos> As this year marks the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the reassertion of these fundamental rights is necessary . <eos> While the U.S. government has much work to do in this regard , there will have to be a concerted international effort to achieve meaningful protection of human rights , even as the issue of security continues to demand our attention . <eos> The American people and our courts have rejected the proposition that some people 's rights can be suspended arbitrarily ; to do so violates the very core of our democracy . <eos> Hopefully , those working to establish democratic practices and institutions worldwide will seize upon this development and convince their own fellow citizens that democracy and human rights are worth the struggle . <eos> The international community , including a newly energized United States , should move swiftly and decisively to support the local heroes who risk much to advance this cause . <eos> Human rights defenders from throughout the world are participating in our annual conference at The Carter Center this week to share the challenges they face , and to decide how the international community can best support their efforts . <eos> For years , these activists have told us that when the United States engaged in torture and indefinite detention , their decades of struggle for rights began to erode . <eos> Dictators who had felt pressure from the United States to improve rights were suddenly off the hook . <eos> With new leadership in Washington , a clear and principled message on the centrality of human rights can help set a new tone . <eos> Too often , the international community has failed to respond to emerging crises , partly because voices of the oppressed are missing in policy discussions . <eos> Had the international community heeded the warning of human rights defenders in the former Yugoslavia , Rwanda , Darfur , and the Democratic Republic of Congo , more robust and coordinated diplomacy and even limited intervention may have averted these crises . <eos> Catastrophic conditions exist in Congo , Zimbabwe , Sudan , Myanmar , Afghanistan and elsewhere and will require unprecedented cooperation to resolve . <eos> It is time to embrace the idea that when human beings are systematically abused , international peace and security are inherently threatened . <eos> In such situations , the global community should spare no effort to help societies in distress . <eos> Crises like these can be assuaged before they escalate if there is determined global leadership and cooperation . <eos> Human rights defenders are on the frontlines of this battle , and we must protect them when they face danger because of their work . <eos> We must do a better job of listening to their diagnoses of issues and be receptive to their proposed solutions . <eos> And we must strengthen their voices and help to protect them in a collective , undeniable commitment to create the world of peace and freedom that many of us enjoy and we all desire .
If Sen. Barack Obama is able to prevail over Sen. John McCain on Tuesday , all of those Democrats who ripped Howard Dean 's 50-state strategy over the last four years should call the head of the Democratic National Committee and offer a heartfelt apology . <eos> First in line should be New York Sen. Charles Schumer , Chicago , Illinois , Rep. Rahm Emanuel and my CNN colleague , political strategist James Carville . <eos> When Democrats were in the final stages of winning back Congress in 2006 , those three were at odds with Dean , saying he should forget about his pie-in-the-sky plan to have the Democratic Party competitive in all 50 states . <eos> They reasoned that money spent on get-out-the vote efforts in non-congressional elections was futile , and all the effort should be on reclaiming Congress . <eos> But Dean resisted their suggestions , weathering repeated calls for him to resign after that election . <eos> Dean 's insistence on having a Democratic Party that existed in the heartland , and not just California , New York and Massachusetts , was brilliant in that it made clear that the party recognized the rest of America . <eos> iReport.com : What would you ask Obama ? . <eos> The Democratic Party earned its liberal label because it ignored the moderate and conservative voices that paved the way for the Reagan revolution to win three consecutive elections . <eos> Yet the decisive wins were n't just on the national level . <eos> Texas is a prime example . <eos> What used to be a blue dog Democratic state now has Republicans holding every statewide office . <eos> But things are looking up . <eos> In Dallas County , all of the county positions except for a handful were in the hands of the GOP , especially the judges . <eos> That changed four years ago , and now the party could solidify itself this time around . <eos> The same thing in Harris County . <eos> The state 's most populous county saw Republicans take everything in sight . <eos> This time around , Democrats are poised to take back Houston and surrounding cities . <eos> Texas Democratic leaders used to cry the blues when an election was near , but after seeing the massive turnout during the primary , they have been able to build their voter database and cultivate a new generation of politicians to run for office . <eos> Will the state go red ? . <eos> Sure . <eos> But with a rock solid black vote , the ability to attract more Hispanic voters and a growing appeal to whites , Democrats may soon make Texas a competitive two-party state . <eos> If Democrats are going to achieve success on the national level , they must have significant enthusiasm on the local level . <eos> It 's hard to get your supporters ginned up for a national campaign if they see no infrastructure , especially local get-out-the-vote operations . <eos> When Obama announced that he was implementing a 50-state strategy , he was laughed at . <eos> But here we are with six days left in the campaign and the Republicans are having to spend precious dollars on ads in Montana , North Carolina , Virginia , Missouri , Iowa , Colorado and Nevada , GOP locks in past elections . <eos> Obama deserves a lot of the credit for this because his `` change '' campaign theme , along with the horrible leadership of Republicans nationwide , is helping his candidacy . <eos> But changing the attitude among the nation 's Democrats was also vital , and that 's where Dean played a role . <eos> The former governor of Vermont saw firsthand the sorry shape of the party when he ran for president in 2004 . <eos> Republicans , led by Karl Rove , perfected their voter registration efforts , targeting voters down to the neighborhood , block and household . <eos> They knew that to win they needed a well-oiled machine that was n't activated every four years ; it needed to be active all year round and in every election cycle . <eos> So Dean put the people and resources behind substantial voter efforts in a number of states , and they went about rebuilding a crippled party that had no central voter registration effort , an outdated database of supporters , a fundraising arm that heavily relied on trial attorneys and Hollywood types , and a message that changed depending on the day . <eos> In addition to seeing how Obama performs on Tuesday , we will also watch and see if Democrats are able to increase the number of governorships and legislatures they control . <eos> That will be critical in 2010 , because that 's when the electoral map will be gerrymandered , redrawing the borders of congressional districts , and the party that rules the general assemblies , legislatures and governor 's mansions will write the rules to the game . <eos> Old pols always said that all politics is local , and the only way for a revitalized Democratic Party to expand its reach nationally is by re-branding the party on the home front . <eos> That takes time , money and leadership , and Howard Dean was willing to put his money where his mouth is .
A single factor never produces a complex event like the historic election of Barack Obama . <eos> But when the final post-mortem on the election of 2008 is someday written , it will no doubt include at least three . <eos> First , John McCain started with three strikes against him . <eos> Those strikes happen to be the three strongest predictors that enter into the equations used by political scientists to predict who will win an election : an unpopular incumbent president ( in this case , the most unpopular in the history of polling ) , an economic downturn ( in this case an understatement ) , and an unpopular war . <eos> In some ways , McCain lost the presidency twice to George W. Bush . <eos> In the 2000 South Carolina primary , McCain was defeated by what have been generously referred to as `` dirty tricks ; '' and in the two-year run-up to the 2008 election , he allied himself with Bush and his policies to win his party 's nomination ( even referring to Bush as `` one of our greatest presidents '' ) , which was his undoing with independent voters in the general election . <eos> Second , whether McCain rues the day he chose Sarah Palin ( who moved from the asset to the liability column around the same time Lehman Brothers did ) , Palin no doubt rues the day she chose to become a small-town mayor instead of a community organizer . <eos> It was precisely the extraordinary capacity to organize people that allowed Obama and his chief advisers to bring such unprecedented numbers of people to the polls . <eos> Not only was this the first election in recent memory in which Democrats outgunned Republicans with their get-out-the-vote efforts , but it was the first time since Eisenhower recognized the potential value of television as a medium for advertising over 50 years ago that Democrats have led Republicans in technology . <eos> From the moment I met Obama 's media wizard , Scott Goodstein , 18 months ago , I realized Obama would have a tremendous advantage on that front , but I did n't realize by how much . <eos> But then there 's that other major factor : For the first time since Bill Clinton , the Democrats chose a candidate with both the general intelligence to govern and the emotional and political intelligence to win . <eos> And they finally abandoned the approach to campaigning that has been their downfall for generations : peppering voters with facts , figures , and policy positions and assuming they will see what a rational choice the candidate is . <eos> We do n't choose any of the important people in our lives that way , whether spouses or presidents . <eos> Obama beat McCain the same way he beat Hillary Clinton : by out-inspiring them , boxing them into the role of the candidate against hope , and defining himself as the candidate who represents change . <eos> And in the last few weeks of the campaign , Obama finally began to control the four stories that matter in an election : . <eos> 1. the story you tell about your yourself ( that he was the candidate of change , fleshing out what he meant by change ) ; . <eos> 2. the story you tell about your opponent ( that McCain was four more years of Bush ) ; . <eos> 3. the story the other candidate is telling about himself ( McCain the maverick , which Obama countered by citing McCain 's proud proclamation that he had voted with Bush over 90 percent of the time and parrying , `` That 's not a maverick , that 's a sidekick '' ) ; and . <eos> 4. the story McCain was telling about Obama ( that he lacked the experience and judgment to lead , which Obama countered with his steadiness in the face of the Wall Street meltdown and his strong , steady performances in the debates ) . <eos> Elections are won by candidates who control those four stories and in so doing inspire the electorate and channel their fears ( in this case , fears about the economy trumping all else ) . <eos> Going forward , Obama needs to find his way as a leader between the excesses of the `` permanent campaign , '' in which a president remains in campaign mode throughout his presidency -- taken to its extreme under George W. Bush , who allowed his political strategist , Karl Rove , an inordinate role in crafting policies rather than just figuring out how to talk with the public about them -- and Obama 's more natural predilection to talk like a law professor . <eos> What Democrats learned from this election is that if their candidate thinks like a professor but inspires like a preacher , they can have their cake and eat it , too . <eos> President-elect Obama faces enormous mountains to climb that will require enormous public support . <eos> He will no doubt pursue the policies he considers best for digging our nation out of some deep ditches , both domestically and internationally . <eos> But the best policies do n't sell themselves , whether the date is November 3 or January 21 , and the style that led him to the White House -- a calm , thoughtful , steady approach to policy combined with an extraordinary capacity to inspire -- is the same style that will make him an extraordinary leader .
Every time the economy and stock market turn down , financial historians get predictable calls from reporters . <eos> Could this be the start of another Great Depression ? . <eos> Could `` it '' possibly happen again ? . <eos> My stock answer has always been no . <eos> The Great Depression resulted from a series of economic and financial shocks -- the end of a housing bubble in 1926 and the end of a high-tech bubble in 1929 -- but also from truly breathtaking neglect and incompetence on the part of policymakers . <eos> It could n't happen again precisely because policymakers know this history . <eos> Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of the Great Depression . <eos> Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson remembers the mistakes of Andrew Mellon , Herbert Hoover 's treasury secretary . <eos> We can be confident , I always answered , that there will not be another Great Depression because policymakers have read financial histories like mine . <eos> At least that was my line until recently . <eos> Now I have stopped taking reporters ' calls . <eos> The first thing that made the Great Depression great , of course , was the Fed 's failure to act . <eos> It basically stood by as the banking system and the economy collapsed around it . <eos> This time , in contrast , the Fed can hardly be criticized for inaction . <eos> Not only has it cut rates , but it has rolled out one new unprecedented initiative after another . <eos> Unfortunately , it has reacted more than acted . <eos> First , it provided funds to the commercial banks . <eos> Then , it targeted broker-dealers . <eos> Now , it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market . <eos> All the while however , the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system . <eos> One thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash . <eos> The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom . <eos> There was a solution : coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe . <eos> Unfortunately , central bankers could n't agree on what was needed . <eos> The result was further instability . <eos> That central banks have learned this lesson of history and now see the need for coordinated action is at least one ground for hope . <eos> The problem is that they have already used their bullets . <eos> iReport.com : What lessons have your family passed down from the Great Depression ? . <eos> U.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero , and the Fed 's policy interest rates are only slightly above that level . <eos> Central banks are out of ammunition . <eos> This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves . <eos> What is needed now is Treasury action to address what has morphed into a global banking crisis . <eos> Between 1930 and 1933 , not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises . <eos> When Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system , its banking crisis only shifted to Germany . <eos> When Germany did the same , the crisis spread to the United States . <eos> This was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst . <eos> We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks , as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system . <eos> G7 leaders , when they meet in Washington at the end of this week , need to explain exactly how they will address this aspect of the problem . <eos> They need to commit money to recapitalizing their banking systems -- now , and not next week . <eos> The U.K. , which has just announced a $ 50 billion plan for bank recapitalization , has shown how this can be done in a matter of days . <eos> But a coordinated initiative will require the U.S. to put up a considerably larger sum . <eos> My recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $ 700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization . <eos> Although the Great Depression started in 1929 , it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks . <eos> We ca n't afford to wait for years this time around . <eos> A final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election . <eos> There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge . <eos> The outgoing president , Hoover , asked his successor designate , Franklin Roosevelt , to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies , but FDR refused to do so . <eos> Meanwhile , the banking crisis deepened . <eos> Corporations failed . <eos> The economy was allowed to spiral downward . <eos> It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2½ months . <eos> The implication is clear . <eos> The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now . <eos> Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5 . <eos> This problem can not wait until Inauguration Day .
My battle for marriage equality began in 1990 , after my partner , Brian Binder , and I had a commitment ceremony . <eos> The ceremony was held at the end of a conference for Parents and Friends of Lesbian and Gays and was attended by more than 300 friends and members of both our families . <eos> We were featured in a couple of books on gay marriage because the concept was so new at the time . <eos> We also registered as domestic partners and entered into every possible form of legal recognition available at the time . <eos> A few years later , Brian was visiting his parents in Nevada to inform them that he was giving up his battle with AIDS . <eos> Something went horribly wrong , and he was rushed to the hospital . <eos> I flew there immediately . <eos> As his caretaker , I knew his medical condition and had been involved in every medical decision . <eos> We had shared the joy of making a commitment to one another and the pain and suffering of a horrible disease . <eos> But when I arrived , I was told I could not see him because I was not `` family '' and because my legal documents were valid only in California . <eos> Even as I heard him calling out my name , they refused to let me see him because we were not married . <eos> Brian died in 1992 . <eos> In 1995 , I helped organize the first Freedom to Marry March in Los Angeles . <eos> Ten years later , the idea for A Day Without Gays was conceived . <eos> iReport.com : Are you taking part in `` A Day Without Gays ? '' . <eos> I was discussing same-sex marriage with Delia Fine , my colleague at the A & E Network . <eos> I proposed a gay version of Lysistrata , an ancient Greek satire about Athenian women who withheld sex from their husbands until they agreed to stop going to war . <eos> She replied , `` what if gays went on strike instead ? '' . <eos> and the idea was born . <eos> We convinced A & E to produce a movie based on the idea , which became a romantic comedy called `` Wedding Wars '' that aired on the network in 2006 . <eos> Critics compared the film to `` A Day Without a Mexican , '' which led to the one-day protest by the Latino community called A Day Without Immigrants . <eos> In the wake of the passage of Proposition 8 in California , which banned same-sex marriage , I posted the event on Facebook . <eos> My fellow organizer , Steve Holzer , inspired by the Latino protests , suggested we call it A Day Without Gays . <eos> We soon discovered that other organizers had conceived of the same idea simultaneously , and we all agreed to schedule the protest for December 10 , which is International Human Rights Day . <eos> A week later , Join The Impact , the group that organized City Hall rallies nationwide November 14 , joined forces with us . <eos> Our goal is to raise awareness that marriage is a `` basic human right '' as declared by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia , the case that ended race-based restrictions on marriage . <eos> We believe that to deny gays and lesbians that right , and the 1,400 state and federal legal and economic benefits of marriage , is discrimination and in violation of the 14th Amendment . <eos> We are asking people who support us to `` call in gay '' to their workplace by taking the day off or to shut down their businesses . <eos> Our goal is to raise awareness that we are gay and lesbian Americans who work , own businesses , pay our taxes and support the economy to the tune of $ 712 billion a year , according to an analysis by Witeck-Combs Communications , a public relations agency that specializes in the gay and lesbian consumer market . <eos> This is a declaration that we take our rights seriously and demand full equality . <eos> Our Facebook site has had a million visitors , and more than 225,000 people indicate that they will or might participate . <eos> There are also more than 17,000 postings from participants who have taken the time to debate , support and/or deride these issues . <eos> There is still much to do . <eos> Thirty states have passed bans on same-sex marriage . <eos> Thirty states allow employers to fire someone based on sexual orientation , according to the American Civil Liberties Union . <eos> Some states have instituted or are considering bans that directly or indirectly prevent gays and lesbians from adopting or fostering children . <eos> In addition , the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act by Congress in 1996 denies civil unions what Barack Obama 's campaign described as the more than 1,100 benefits of marriage including immigration , taxation , Social Security and veteran 's benefits . <eos> A recent Newsweek poll reflects that , for the first time , a majority of Americans now believe that gay and lesbian couples deserve recognition , with 55 percent supporting legally sanctioned unions . <eos> It found increased backing for inheritance and other rights and found that 39 percent favor gay marriage . <eos> The tide is clearly turning in our favor , and I believe that love , equality and support for all families will triumph . <eos> In the words of Tony Kushner , `` We will be citizens . <eos> The time has come . '' .
I 'll never forget my first day in The House that Ruth Built : April 9 , 1962 , the day before opening day . <eos> I made the team that spring as a non-roster player , having pitched in the Texas League ( AA ) the year before . <eos> And I had just turned 23 . <eos> The Yankees had scheduled an afternoon workout , but I was so excited that I could n't sleep and I drove in from my parents ' house in New Jersey at 7 in the morning . <eos> After introducing myself to a skeptical guard , he led me down two flights of stairs and through a hallway , where I was greeted by the clubhouse man Pete Sheehy ( who died in 1985 and for whom the room is now named ) . <eos> The Yankee clubhouse in 1962 was like a large subterranean living room . <eos> A wall-to-wall grayish green carpet muffled all sound , and the overhead lighting was subdued . <eos> Three walls of walk-in wood lockers faced a wall of large frosted windows that cast shafts of light from the street above . <eos> Everything was painted a muted gray green to match the carpet , including the exposed ductwork in the ceiling above . <eos> A cleat-dented wooden stool sat in front of each locker . <eos> And hanging in the lockers , with military precision , were the classic Yankee uniforms . <eos> `` Your locker is right here by the door , '' said Pete . <eos> I could n't help smiling when I saw Whitey Ford 's nameplate just one locker away . <eos> I asked Pete if this was the same room that Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and all those guys used . <eos> He pointed to a locker across the room where he used to bring `` a bi-carb and coffee '' each day to the Babe . <eos> Pete returned to his duties and I touched my uniform reverently . <eos> With no one around , I decided to try it on . <eos> Perfect fit . <eos> I adjusted my hat in a mirror . <eos> That looked good , too . <eos> iReport.com : Share your memories of Yankee Stadium . <eos> Then I grabbed my glove and went out to the field -- you know , just to get oriented . <eos> After sitting in the dugout a few minutes , I trotted out to the mound . <eos> Looking up at the three tiers of stands was like being in the Roman Coliseum . <eos> Of course , I had to toe the rubber and look in for the sign . <eos> Fortunately , at that hour of the morning , it was just me and the pigeons . <eos> What would it be like to pitch there when the stands were filled with people ? . <eos> My big chance came on May 7 , 1962 , in the second game of a double-header against the Washington Senators , in front of a real crowd that included my Mom and Dad , my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from New Jersey . <eos> I was thrilled and scared at the same time -- maybe a little more on the scared side . <eos> I walked the bases loaded with nobody out . <eos> Then I fell behind 3 and 1 on the fourth hitter . <eos> My next pitch was a little bit high and manager Ralph Houk stepped out of the dugout - either to calm me down or remove me from the premises . <eos> But the umpire , bless him , called it a strike and Houk stepped back into the dugout . <eos> The inning seemed to last forever , but I finally got out of it and ended up pitching a complete game shutout . <eos> Maybe the worst shutout in history - 7 walks and 7 hits . <eos> After the game Houk said to me , `` any more shutouts like that and we 're going to need a new bullpen . '' . <eos> The best part was when I walked into the clubhouse after the game . <eos> I arrived a few minutes late because I 'd done a TV interview in the dugout . <eos> And when I opened the door , there was a path of white towels leading to my locker -- and Mickey Mantle was laying down the last towel . <eos> This is my favorite memory of Yankee Stadium . <eos> Unless it was Mantle 's 9th inning walk-off home run in '64 World Series that beat the Cardinals 2-1 , which also happened to be my first World Series win . <eos> After that it was all down hill . <eos> In 1968 a sore arm got me traded to the Seattle Pilots for a bag of batting practice balls . <eos> That 's the year I kept a diary that became Ball Four -- a book that also mentioned Mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium for 28 years . <eos> My eventual return to Yankee Stadium came after my son Michael wrote a letter to the New York Times , saying the Yankees should let bygones be bygones and invite me back . <eos> It was such a beautiful letter the Yankees were embarrassed into inviting me . <eos> After 28 years , Yankee Stadium was a different place -- a strange and garish place . <eos> A makeover in 1973-75 , under the new owner George Steinbrenner , added cantilevered stands that destroyed the elegant upper façade , and exterior elevators which spoiled the view of the of the lower facade . <eos> Inside , the grayish green carpet was now bright blue and featured a giant Yankee logo . <eos> The honest ceiling with its exposed pipes was now a dropped ceiling with stark white tiles . <eos> Everything was painted blue and white -- the Yankee colors , get it ? . <eos> Now , instead of restoring the stadium , they 're going to tear it down . <eos> Raze the clubhouse where Pete Sheehy made coffee for Ruth . <eos> Destroy the dugout where Stengel slept . <eos> Bulldoze the field where Mantle roamed and level the mound where Larsen pitched the only perfect World Series game . <eos> And they 're going to build an underground parking garage on the site ! . <eos> This will no doubt be `` The Garage that Ruth Built '' -- which could produce a reverse `` Curse of the Bambino . '' . <eos> If you check the current standings , you 'll see this may already be happening .
Today Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States of America . <eos> This is the day for which so many prayed , so many marched and so many more sacrificed . <eos> This is a day of jubilation and celebration . <eos> This is the day to rejoice and recommit ourselves to restoring the American dream for us all . <eos> Barack Obama 's election offers our country the opportunity to open a new chapter that will allow us to turn the corner on past prejudices and racial politics . <eos> When Sen. Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007 , most people , black and white , thought it would be , at best , an interesting sideshow . <eos> After Obama 's victories in the early primaries , there came the controversial videos of the Rev . <eos> Jeremiah Wright , broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an Obama candidacy . <eos> But the senator moved quickly to reassure people that Wright 's jaundiced view of America did not reflect his own . <eos> Americans wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division . <eos> Obama understood that . <eos> And so did the voters . <eos> But African-Americans did n't believe it . <eos> Seventy-one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime , according to a national poll released in November by CNN/Opinion Research Corp . <eos> Yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible . <eos> Obama did not just win the caucuses in Iowa -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it . <eos> Other primary victories , once thought improbable , soon followed . <eos> These included Georgia , and Virginia , the former seat of the Confederacy . <eos> On Election Day , Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did in 2004 , though he did not get a majority of whites . <eos> Unlike other black presidential candidates before him , Obama did not run as `` the black candidate . '' . <eos> He ran as a Democratic candidate , a U.S. senator from Illinois , and a progressive . <eos> And America , by larger margins than in previous recent elections , voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial . <eos> For too long , race has been the stain on the American fabric . <eos> As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us , race has been our `` nation 's birth defect . '' . <eos> At times during the long primary and general election , race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue . <eos> Nor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama . <eos> The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin . <eos> A lot of lessons were taught November 4 . <eos> Obama 's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans : White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were ; a solution to our country 's lingering racial problem may eventually be found ; and the Rev . <eos> Martin Luther King 's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach . <eos> Obama 's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States . <eos> `` A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country 's racial problems will eventually be found , '' said CNN polling director Keating Holland . <eos> `` In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993 , black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape . <eos> Even in the most recent polls taken last week , a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country 's racial problems could be within reach ; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end . '' . <eos> Yes , of course , racism still exists in America . <eos> But if a black man can become president of the United States of America , then are n't all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves ? . <eos> So on this day , let us all rejoice and be glad . <eos> Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground . <eos> Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America , as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations , dies the same death it did in the November ballot box . <eos> What our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev . <eos> King fought and died for , we are perhaps finally ready to achieve . <eos> This is a remarkable moment . <eos> Though not the apex we need to reach , it is still a mountaintop , alive with possibilities , a dream no longer deferred .
In his concession speech on Tuesday night , John McCain illustrated the historic significance of Barack Obama 's election by noting that a little over a century ago the inclusion of another black man , Booker T. Washington , at a White House dinner provoked outrage in large parts of the country . <eos> McCain was n't giving a history lecture , and he quickly moved on , but the tale is worth exploring , as it is both more complex and more instructive than McCain 's brief remarks suggested . <eos> Washington was the one who initiated the acquaintance that led to his 1901 dinner with Theodore Roosevelt . <eos> Washington had built the Tuskegee Institute of Alabama into a political base that made him the most powerful black leader in the country . <eos> Invited to address the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta , Georgia , in 1895 , Washington offered white America a racial bargain : Blacks would cease agitating for immediate political and civil rights if whites would fund black educational and economic advancement . <eos> This `` Atlanta Compromise '' outraged black intellectuals like W. E. B . <eos> Du Bois , but it appealed to white leaders in the South and white philanthropists in the North -- and it marked Washington , the broker of Northern largesse and Southern cooperation , as one of the shrewdest politicians in the South . <eos> Washington spotted Roosevelt on the rise , and after Roosevelt became vice president , Washington invited him to Tuskegee , where he knew Roosevelt , the apostle of the strenuous life , would be entranced by the rigorous physical regimen the students pursued . <eos> Roosevelt was preparing to visit Tuskegee when the assassination of William McKinley elevated him to the presidency and threw his plans into turmoil . <eos> Roosevelt instead invited Washington to call at the White House whenever he was in town . <eos> Washington did n't have to be asked twice . <eos> Within weeks , he was in the capital and was invited to join the president for dinner on October 16 . <eos> Roosevelt 's ascension to the presidency made him that much more interesting to Washington . <eos> Yet no more interesting than Washington was to Roosevelt . <eos> The peculiar politics of the Republican Party gave Washington an importance among Republicans that belied the abnegations of the Atlanta Compromise . <eos> Discriminatory Jim Crow laws kept most blacks from voting in the South , but they did n't prevent the Southern states from sending delegations to the Republican national conventions every four years . <eos> These delegations could tip the balance in a tight contest , and Roosevelt -- who though president was profoundly unpopular among the Republican bosses -- expected the 1904 convention to be a tight contest . <eos> Roosevelt 's invitation to Washington to dine at the White House had little to do with Washington 's race per se , but everything to do with Washington 's role as a political boss of Southern Republicans who happened to be black . <eos> Likewise , the outrage expressed by Southern editors and spokesmen over Roosevelt 's alleged affront to the South , while couched in the language of race , was really about political power . <eos> `` White men of the South , how do you like it ? '' . <eos> fulminated the New Orleans Times-Democrat . <eos> `` White women of the South , how do you like it ? '' . <eos> The Richmond Times frothed over the implications of the honor Roosevelt had bestowed on Washington : `` It means that the president is willing that Negroes shall mingle freely with whites in the social circle -- that white women may receive attentions from negro men ; it means that there is no racial reason in his opinion why whites and blacks may not marry and intermarry , why the Anglo-Saxon may not mix negro blood with his blood . '' . <eos> The vehemence of the Southern response gave the game away . <eos> Booker Washington had explicitly forsworn any claim to social equality , let alone the right for blacks to marry whites . <eos> What the Southern foamers , political conservatives to a man , feared was that Washington might help the dangerously progressive Roosevelt get elected in his own right . <eos> When he did precisely that -- Roosevelt fended off the conservatives at the 1904 convention and was returned to office overwhelmingly -- they foamed the more . <eos> The race question in America has often been about race , but it has equally often been about power . <eos> Not for 40 years , since the dismantling of the Jim Crow system , has the race of guests at the White House prompted anything other than idle curiosity . <eos> But until last Tuesday those African-Americans among the guests were precisely that : guests -- visitors who lacked the power that occupancy of the White House entails . <eos> Symbolism is n't unimportant , and the symbolism of a black man taking the oath of the president 's office in January will certainly bring an outpouring of sentiment like that which greeted Obama 's election . <eos> But behind the symbolism of race is the reality of power . <eos> Obama will wield power of an order Booker Washington appreciated in Roosevelt but never possessed for himself . <eos> A week or a month after the symbolism fades , the reality will remain . <eos> At that point , Obama 's race wo n't matter nearly as much as his facility with power . <eos> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H.W .

'' . <eos> He ran as a Democratic candidate , a U.S. senator from Illinois , and a progressive . <eos> And America , by larger margins than in previous recent elections , voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial . <eos> For too long , race has been the stain on the American fabric . <eos> As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us , race has been our `` nation 's birth defect . '' . <eos> At times during the long primary and general election , race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue . <eos> Nor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama . <eos> The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin . <eos> A lot of lessons were taught November 4 . <eos> Obama 's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans : White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were ; a solution to our country 's lingering racial problem may eventually be found ; and the Rev . <eos> Martin Luther King 's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach . <eos> Obama 's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States . <eos> `` A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country 's racial problems will eventually be found , '' said CNN polling director Keating Holland . <eos> `` In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993 , black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape . <eos> Even in the most recent polls taken last week , a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country 's racial problems could be within reach ; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end . '' . <eos> Yes , of course , racism still exists in America . <eos> But if a black man can become president of the United States of America , then are n't all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves ? . <eos> So on this day , let us all rejoice and be glad . <eos> Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground . <eos> Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America , as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations , dies the same death it did in the November ballot box . <eos> What our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev . <eos> King fought and died for , we are perhaps finally ready to achieve . <eos> This is a remarkable moment . <eos> Though not the apex we need to reach , it is still a mountaintop , alive with possibilities , a dream no longer deferred .
President-elect Barack Obama has been holding his economic cards close to his vest . <eos> He did not participate in person at last weekend 's meeting of G20 leaders . <eos> He has been reluctant to encourage the lame-duck Congress to adopt a major fiscal stimulus package . <eos> He may be right in saying that the U.S. has only one president at a time . <eos> But this makes it all the more important that he hit the ground running on January 20 . <eos> This will mean , first of all , addressing the credit crisis . <eos> Despite all the actions of the Fed and the Treasury , the banks are still not lending . <eos> In some cases this is because their own finances are weak . <eos> But in others it is because they have other more convenient uses for their funds , ranging from acquisitions to dividend payments . <eos> This reflects a flawed bank recapitalization scheme that gives the government no voting shares in the banks into which it is injecting public funds and hence no say in their decisions . <eos> Fortunately ( as it were ) there will be an opportunity to correct this , since as the recession deepens there will be more loan losses and the need for more capital injections . <eos> The next round of public money should come with voting rights so that taxpayers ' interests are protected . <eos> Then there is the need for increased public spending on infrastructure and federal grants to state and local governments to offset the collapse of private spending . <eos> Candidate Obama spoke of $ 150 billion of fiscal stimulus . <eos> But if this recession turns out to be the deepest since World War II , as now seems certain , the appropriate figure will be at least four times that large . <eos> Anything less would fail to cushion the downturn . <eos> A trillion-dollar deficit will excite fears of government out of control if not accompanied by a plan to balance the budget once the recession ends . <eos> The new president therefore will need to offer not just a stimulus package but also a multiyear budget . <eos> Then there is the problem of the auto industry . <eos> The best course normally would be Chapter 11 bankruptcy . <eos> This would allow the Big Three to shed bad management and contracts , both of which would be thrown out in the bankruptcy process . <eos> If GM , Ford or Chrysler is then able to come up with a viable business plan , they should be able to obtain the new money , known as debtor-in-possession financing , needed to implement it . <eos> Admittedly , the credit crisis makes new money difficult to obtain . <eos> But if this is a problem , then the government can provide the debtor-in-possession financing . <eos> In other words , it can make its aid conditional on the Big Three first going through bankruptcy workouts . <eos> A further complication arises from the fact that cars last for years and when they break down are expensive to repair . <eos> Warranties matter , in other words . <eos> If a producer was undergoing bankruptcy reorganization , from which it might or might not emerge , consumers would question whether its warranties were worth the paper they were written on . <eos> But if this is the problem , then the government can guarantee the warranties . <eos> It could reimburse the cost of major repairs subject to terms and conditions . <eos> It is not as if our government has been reluctant to guarantee other products , ranging from bank deposits to money market mutual funds . <eos> And this guarantee should be provided only to auto companies that undergo bankruptcy reorganization . <eos> Finally , it will be important for the new president to reassure our foreign partners about his economic intentions . <eos> There may be jubilation in Kenya and Indonesia over the election of a candidate they may view as a native son , but there is trepidation in Asia and Latin America about his protectionist rhetoric . <eos> President Obama will need to reassure Mexico that while he believes in labor and environmental standards , he also believes in NAFTA . <eos> He should encourage the Congress to ratify our free trade agreements with Colombia and Korea . <eos> He should reassure the Chinese , who now have economic problems of their own , that he will not bash them over their exchange rate policies . <eos> If Obama wishes to help Americans impacted by import competition there are better ways . <eos> He can expand trade adjustment assistance for displaced workers . <eos> He can propose wage insurance -- partial compensation for a limited period for workers moving to lower-paid jobs . <eos> He can ramp up spending on education and training . <eos> He can address concerns over the environment by proposing a carbon tax rather than allowing blame for global warming to be shifted to Mexico and China . <eos> That should be enough to keep the new president occupied for his first 100 days .
Much of President Bush 's news conference today was a defense of the many controversial decisions of his presidency , it was also reflective , with the president showing a willingness to admit and talk about the serious mistakes made by this administration . <eos> But on one topic in particular , he seemed almost entirely disconnected from what really happened : Hurricane Katrina . <eos> As someone who spent many days in New Orleans , Louisiana , after Hurricane Katrina , I was taken aback listening to the president talk about the government 's response . <eos> President Bush : . <eos> `` People said , 'Well , the federal response was slow . ' . <eos> Do n't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed . <eos> I remember going to see those helicopter drivers , Coast Guard drivers , to thank them for their courageous efforts to rescue people off roofs . <eos> Thirty-thousand people were pulled off roofs right after the storm moved through . <eos> It 's a pretty quick response . <eos> Could things have been done better ? . <eos> Absolutely . <eos> Absolutely . <eos> But when I hear people say , the federal response was slow , then what are they going to say to those chopper drivers , or the 30,000 that got pulled off the roofs ? '' . <eos> It is impossible to challenge what so many of us witnessed firsthand -- what the entire country witnessed through television day and night : New Orleans was a city for a time abandoned by the government ; where people old and young were left at the New Orleans convention center for days with no water or food . <eos> People will disagree over aspects of the Bush legacy , but on the government 's handling of Katrina ? . <eos> We were there . <eos> Watch Campbell Brown 's reaction to President Bush 's news conference » . <eos> The whole country saw what happened . <eos> People stuck on roofs were one part of a massive catastrophe . <eos> But there was so much else the government did n't do . <eos> To this day that city is fighting for its life . <eos> Mr. President , you can not pat yourself on the back for that one . <eos> We will debate the war in Iraq , national security , the economy and the rest of your legacy . <eos> Those debates will continue for years to come . <eos> But on how you handled Katrina , there is no debate .
Why do we watch ? . <eos> Bob Greene says athletes like Lebron James show us the difference between ordinary effort and excellence . <eos> The question applies not just to Sunday 's NBA All-Star Game , although that is the immediate case in point . <eos> The outcome of the game is not important -- few people remember who wins the All-Star Game from year to year . <eos> The players , while attempting to win , do it with barely concealed smiles on their faces . <eos> All-Star weekend is mostly a class reunion for basketball 's elite . <eos> But all the games , in all the seasons , in all the big-time sports leagues -- what is the real reason we keep on watching ? . <eos> You might think that we 'd finally grow weary of caring , with headlines about Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds , with the sports pages often reading like the business pages ( contract disputes and stadium bond-issue negotiations and salary arbitration ) , with police-blotter details sometimes pushing aside the box scores . <eos> Why do we watch ? . <eos> The answer may be found in a single sentence written by a man who died at the age of 76 in this still-new year . <eos> John Updike , his literary brilliance aside , was prolific almost beyond belief -- he wrote more than 50 books , and hundreds upon hundreds of essays , short stories , articles , poems and works of criticism . <eos> All those careful words , year after year , decade after decade . <eos> But of all the sentences Updike ever wrote , there is one that I have long encouraged people to carry around with them -- if not literally tucked into their wallets , then somewhere in their heads and in their hearts . <eos> In that sentence of Updike 's lies the secret to a lot of things -- including the secret that answers : Why do we watch ? . <eos> The sentence appeared in Updike 's 1960 nonfiction piece about Ted Williams 's last game for the Boston Red Sox . <eos> That piece is famous for how Updike explained Williams 's refusal to come out of the dugout and acknowledge the cheering , crying fans after his home run in his final at-bat : `` Gods do not answer letters . '' . <eos> But it is another sentence in the story that explains everything -- not just about sports , but about the lives the rest of us can lead . <eos> Referring to Ted Williams , Updike wrote : . <eos> `` For me , Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday , before a small crowd , when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill. '' There it is , right there . <eos> That tissue-thin difference , when you do n't necessarily know anyone is watching -- there is the answer . <eos> We all face the choice in our lives every day : to make the extra effort or not , to stay at the desk for the extra fifteen minutes or to go home , to revise the project one more time before handing it in or to settle for something acceptable , if not quite excellent . <eos> On fields of play -- baseball diamonds , football fields , a basketball court like the one on which Sunday 's All-Star Game will be held -- the tissue-thin difference is there for the world to see . <eos> The lights are dazzlingly bright ; the television cameras carry the close-ups around the globe . <eos> If a player is dogging it , we can tell ; if a player is jogging instead of sprinting , it 's self-evident ; if a player 's mind is already at the party that will be held after the final buzzer , we know . <eos> Yet once in a while -- we can see it in a player 's eyes -- we are rewarded . <eos> Once in a while , sometimes when we are least expecting to witness it , it 's there : a tiny move , an all-but-imperceptible lunge , an additional thrust , a reach beyond that which should by all reason be reachable . <eos> It was true during small and glorious moments in the days when Bob Cousy and Elgin Baylor were on the basketball court ; it is true during small and glorious moments today , when Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are on the court . <eos> Updike 's tissue-thin difference . <eos> A thing done well , when the player could have gotten away with a thing done ill. Are the rest of us the same as the players on the court ? . <eos> In most ways , no . <eos> We lack their athletic skill , their physical grace , their monetary riches . <eos> They hear cheers every working night ; we toil in silence . <eos> And yet , the one way in which we can be the same , or at least strive to , is in that pursuit of the tissue-thin difference . <eos> The thing that makes the best of them different is the thing that offers us , too , the potential to earn that difference -- the effort beyond mere effort , the desire beyond standard-issue desire , the pride so strong that it becomes the definition of pride . <eos> Why do we watch ? . <eos> We watch for those moments . <eos> They may be fleeting ; they may come and go so quickly we 're not even certain , for an instant , that we actually saw them . <eos> But they 're real , and they can be ours . <eos> We wait for them .
First , we 're a nation of whiners ; now , we 're a nation of cowards . <eos> The coward comment comes from none other than President Obama 's newly minted attorney general , Eric Holder . <eos> The remarks were part of a speech Holder delivered for Black History Month . <eos> Yet , even in that context , the words came across as arrogant , condescending and not at all becoming a statesman . <eos> One dictionary definition of coward is `` lacking courage . '' . <eos> Stinging words for a country at war , where white and black soldiers are shedding the same color blood . <eos> Are they cowards ? . <eos> Ironic too that Holder 's remarks come at a time when the nation has just elected its first black president and witnessed the confirmation of its first black attorney general ( Holder himself ) . <eos> Forget that more whites than blacks cast their ballots for a black man to lead the nation . <eos> So this is how Holder says thanks ? . <eos> Did the attorney general not think about the weight his words would carry ? . <eos> Was he simply trying to be provocative ? . <eos> Is this his way of bringing the races together ? . <eos> Does his position or his color give him the bravado to think that he can get away with calling us cowards ? . <eos> Imagine for a moment if John McCain or George W. Bush uttered those words . <eos> The criticism would have known no bounds . <eos> i-Report.com : Share your thoughts on Holder 's comments . <eos> You 'll recall , it was just a few months back that a media frenzy erupted when former Sen. Phil Gramm called national leaders ( not the nation ) a bunch of `` whiners . '' . <eos> Media pundits and broadcasters blasted Gramm for weeks , until he was forced off McCain 's campaign . <eos> Gramm 's words , while true , were mild in comparison to Holder 's . <eos> Where is that same outrage and moral condemnation over Holder 's loose lips ? . <eos> It 's a rhetorical question , of course . <eos> And as much as we are constantly reminded of the past `` mistakes '' this country has made , is there nothing worth celebrating , no times when racial harmony brought racial reconciliation ? . <eos> Little of that made it to Holder 's speech . <eos> Instead , he chose the celebratory occasion to exact punishment by way of guilt . <eos> It makes one wonder , why does every race speech by those on the left have to begin ( and end ) with repudiation and insult ? . <eos> Why must there be a constant reminder of what went wrong without giving due recognition to what went right ? . <eos> I will acknowledge that the country can always do better when it comes to race , but as much as Republicans are accused of refusing to admit racism exists , assuredly Democrats exploit it for every inch of territory they can garner . <eos> They point fingers , threaten and name-call without offering real solutions or substantive conversation . <eos> One regular reader of The Washington Times , a Democrat , forwarded me a letter he sent to Holder , telling the attorney general how much he `` applauds '' his remarks but saying he had one request : `` I would like to recommend that your office take the lead in ensuring the appointment of at least one African-American on every committee and task force that is created by the President of the United States and current cabinet Secretary 's . '' . <eos> How 's that for affirmative action on demand ? . <eos> More like affirmative extortion . <eos> The writer also stated in closing : `` Let us ( by `` us , '' he means black folks ) take advantage of every opportunity that is before us . '' . <eos> I was particularly struck by the words `` take advantage . '' . <eos> It is a line of thinking and supposed reasoning to justify black Americans getting what 's `` due . '' . <eos> This was just one person 's opinion , but it reflects a sentiment shared by many liberals . <eos> It also reveals a get-it-all-while-you-can mentality that has nothing to do with parity , equality or justice but rather with guilt trips , paybacks and quotas . <eos> This is not how the `` case for race '' should be made . <eos> To be fair , there are some points Holder made with which I do agree ( at least in part ) . <eos> `` We , average Americans , simply do not talk enough with each other about race , '' Holder stated . <eos> It is a challenge for each of us , black , white , Hispanic , Asian , to go outside our comfort zone and reach out to someone `` different '' from ourselves ( though I 've done it my whole life ) . <eos> It is an observation that , while true , should n't just apply to white people . <eos> It applies to black folks , too . <eos> Yet that 's where the discussion of race loses traction among liberals . <eos> Holder does n't really want to `` talk '' about race , because that would entail not only encouraging blacks to reach out , but it would mean addressing black racism -- which we 've seen in the likes of one Rev . <eos> Jeremiah Wright -- in addition to white racism ( and all racism ) . <eos> Yes , we are sometimes too `` socially segregated , '' as Holder put it , but cowards we are not . <eos> And mere rhetoric and rancor does nothing to elevate the discussion . <eos> In contrast to Holder 's bombastic speech , President Bush 's Black History Month speech last year was refreshingly retrospective without being pretentious . <eos> While condemning present-day acts of racism ( i.e . <eos> hanging nooses ) , Bush also offered a way forward . <eos> `` We renew our commitment to securing liberty and justice for every American , '' Bush said , focusing on the present instead of the past : `` We honor four Americans who ... are leading the way toward ending racial injustice across our land . '' . <eos> Rhetoric aside , what was lacking from Holder 's remarks was a way forward . <eos> Instead of `` hope , '' Holder offered more hate veiled in subtle anger . <eos> Last year , Obama gave a famous speech on race , addressing the controversy about the remarks of his former pastor , Wright , and urging people not to wallow in resentment : . <eos> Obama said , `` The profound mistake of Rev . <eos> Wright 's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society . <eos> It 's that he spoke as if our society was static , as if no progress had been made , as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black , Latino and Asian , rich and poor , young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past . '' . <eos> Obama 's speech sums it all up . <eos> Holder 's is a contradiction .
I 've never been one to attend the performances of symphony orchestras , but off and on , for more than 35 years , I gave myself the gift of something even better : . <eos> Paul Harvey received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bush in 2005 . <eos> I would go and sit with Paul Harvey as he broadcast his radio show . <eos> It was music ; it was thrilling . <eos> I met him in the early 1970s , when I was a young newspaper reporter in Chicago , and that 's when he allowed me , for the first time , to sit silently in his studio as he did his work . <eos> Over the years , whenever I felt a need for a Paul Harvey fix , he was always welcoming , and we came to know each other well . <eos> I would sit there wordlessly and observe absolute excellence . <eos> He would invariably be wearing a smock when I arrived -- he had been working since well before the sun came up , and the smock would cover his shirt and tie . <eos> It was the kind of smock a jeweler might wear , or a watchmaker -- it was crisply pressed , the uniform of an expert craftsman . <eos> I never asked him why he wore it , but I suspect that was the reason -- pride in craftsmanship . <eos> He would be at the typewriter , honing his script . <eos> He was famed for his voice , but the writing itself was so beautiful -- his respect for words , his understanding of the potency of economy , his instinct for removing the superfluous . <eos> The world heard him speak , but the world never saw him write , and I think he honored both aspects of his skill equally . <eos> He would walk down the hallway to his studio just minutes before airtime . <eos> The studio itself -- when I first knew him it was on the west side of North Michigan Avenue , and in later years he moved it to the east side of the street -- was far from lavish . <eos> It was impossible to equate the spartan surroundings with the idea that his voice was leaving this little room and traveling around the world . <eos> Maybe that was the point : He worked for the illusion of unfussy intimacy . <eos> He would make these warm-up noises -- voice exercises , silly-sounding tweets and yodels , strange little un-Paul-Harvey-like sounds -- and he showed no self-consciousness about doing it in front of someone else , because would a National Football League linebacker be self-conscious about someone seeing him stretch before a game , would a National Basketball Association forward be worried about someone seeing him leap up and down before tipoff ? . <eos> This was Paul Harvey 's arena , and he would get the voice ready , loosening it , easing it up to the starting line . <eos> And then the signal from the booth , and . <eos> . . `` Hello , Americans ! . <eos> This is Paul Harvey ! . <eos> Stand by . <eos> . . for news ! '' . <eos> And he would look down at those words that had come out of his typewriter minutes before -- some of them underlined to remind him to punch them hard -- and they became something grander than ink on paper , they became the song , the Paul Harvey symphony . <eos> He would allow me to sit right with him in the little room -- he never made me watch from behind the glass -- and there were moments , when his phrases , his word choices , were so perfect -- flawlessly written , flawlessly delivered -- that I just wanted to stand up and cheer . <eos> But of course I never did any such thing -- in Paul Harvey 's studio , if you felt a tickle in your throat you would begin to panic , because you knew that if you so much as coughed it would go out over the air into cities and towns all across the continent -- so there were never any cheers . <eos> The impulse was always there , though -- when he would drop one of those famous Paul Harvey pauses into the middle of a sentence , letting it linger , proving once again the power of pure silence , the tease of anticipation , you just wanted to applaud for his mastery of his life 's work . <eos> iReport.com : Share your memories of radio legend Harvey . <eos> He probably would n't have thought of himself this way , but he was the ultimate singer-songwriter . <eos> He wrote the lyrics . <eos> And then he went onto his stage and performed them . <eos> The cadences that came out of his fingertips at the typewriter were designed to be translated by one voice -- his voice -- and he did it every working day for more than half a century : did it so well that he became a part of the very atmosphere , an element of the American air . <eos> He had difficult years toward the end . <eos> At one point there was a problem with his vocal cords , and he had to leave his broadcast for an extended period ; when he came back he told me he had felt fear and the deepest kind of despondency , because he thought he might be finished . <eos> He was n't ; he was able to work again , and then in the last 12 months he became ill , and his beloved wife , Angel , died ; he turned 90 and he was n't on the air as much . <eos> I was in St. Louis last fall to cover the vice presidential debate , and I was taking a morning walk through the suburb of Clayton . <eos> I was on Wydown Boulevard , on a sidewalk beneath some old and thick trees , and the cell phone in my pocket rang . <eos> It was Mr. Harvey . <eos> I did n't know exactly why he was calling that day , and I still am not certain , but my sense was that he just felt a need to talk . <eos> This was during the time when his radio appearances had become sporadic ; I knew how lonely he was without Mrs. Harvey . <eos> The voice , of course , was much older , and not as strong , but it was his voice , arriving out of the air in yet another American town , and what I said to him then is what I will say to you now : It was wonderful to hear it again . <eos> I walked down the street , his voice in my ear .
When stock markets are soaring , people think they 're making money because they 're geniuses . <eos> But when the market tanks -- which it always does , sooner or later -- people look for villains to blame for their losses . <eos> Allan Sloan says the real lesson of the Madoff case is not to rely on others to protect your investments . <eos> That brings us to Bernie Madoff , who has become the iconic symbol of the current horrible market and economic meltdown , even though he really had nothing to do with it . <eos> Yes , Madoff sure seems to be a really , really bad guy who ruined lots and lots of lives and should probably be locked up for the rest of his natural days . <eos> But Madoff 's misdeeds -- or as our lawyers would prefer , his alleged misdeeds -- have nothing to do with the market meltdown that has sliced trillions of dollars from our collective net worth . <eos> He 's become the symbol of the current meltdown the same way that uber-tastemaker Martha Stewart became a face of the 2001-02 corporate crime wave , even though the misdeeds of which she was convicted -- misleading government investigators -- were less than penny-ante compared to the multi-billion dollar frauds that first built up and then destroyed giant companies such as Enron and WorldCom . <eos> Along with Madoff , the Securities and Exchange Commission is being portrayed as the villain of the piece , having failed to catch him long ago when his alleged depredations must have been much smaller . <eos> Instead , it gave him a few wrist slaps until he confessed his misdeeds a month ago . <eos> But , tips from Boston money manager Harry Markopoulos over the years notwithstanding , it 's not at all surprising that the SEC missed Madoff . <eos> In fact , I 'd have been amazed if the SEC had been the ones to catch him . <eos> Why ? . <eos> I do n't want to seem cynical or jaded , but after almost 40 years of covering business news , I 've seen the same thing happen over and over because of the way regulators are trained . <eos> If someone runs a little bit out of the baseline by chiseling on numbers or playing some other game , regulators are pretty good at catching him ( or her ) . <eos> But if -- like Madoff -- you make up numbers from scratch and deal with huge sums , you 're so far out of the baseline that regulators are n't looking for you there . <eos> It 's very hard for an SEC regulator to wrap his head around the idea that an establishment guy like Madoff -- a Nasdaq market pioneer and an occasional consultant to the SEC -- is capable of just making things up out of whole cloth . <eos> But , it would appear , he was . <eos> And as an aside , it 's easy to blame George W. Bush 's anti-regulation policies for the SEC not catching Madoff . <eos> But Markopoulos ' original tips reached the SEC when Bill Clinton was president . <eos> Like newspapers , where I used to work , regulators get all sorts of tips coming across the transom . <eos> As in newspapers , I suspect , many of the tips end up ignored . <eos> Markopoulos was right about Madoff 's operation being a fraud . <eos> But his magnum opus -- an 18-page 2005 letter listing 29 `` red flags '' -- is quite dense and confusing , probably because he 'd gotten frustrated after years of not being taken very seriously . <eos> Unfortunately , the letter did n't list what would have been ( in hindsight , naturally ) the simplest tip-off : that this supposedly multi-billion dollar operation was audited by an obscure three-person accounting firm . <eos> As Jim Heatherington , a Tulsa , Oklahoma , certified public accountant , pointed out to me after reading a Madoff column I wrote for Fortune , a simple database search shows that the firm had n't had a peer review since 1990 . <eos> That would -- or should -- have set off all sorts of alarm bells . <eos> Back to the main event . <eos> Ponzi schemes , in which you pay existing investors not by making a profit but by getting money from new investors , have been around forever . <eos> Like Madoff , a Jew who preyed on fellow Jews and Jewish charities such as Elie Wiesel 's foundation , Ponzi schemers often target their own religious or ethnic groups . <eos> That way , they lure victims who feel flattered at having been asked to join an elite society , so much so that many of them fail to find out basic things , such as whether the securities or properties they 're supposedly being put into actually exist . <eos> Consider these : Tom Petters , a prominent Minnesota businessman is charged with running a multi-billion dollar scam that preyed on evangelical Christians . <eos> A New York City man was recently accused of preying on fellow members of a Hispanic church . <eos> A Haitian-American in Miami was accused on December . <eos> 30 of preying on other Haitian-Americans . <eos> Just yesterday , the SEC accused a Williamsville , N.Y. , man of preying on fellow Catholics . <eos> If someone , especially a member of your racial , religious or social group , offers you a deal not available to the general public , check it out . <eos> Very diligently . <eos> Do n't rely on the SEC or any other regulator to do that for you . <eos> Never , never , never put all your eggs in one basket , no matter how good it looks . <eos> And that , my friends , is the real bottom line . <eos> Pillory Madoff and mock him all you like , he has it coming . <eos> But learn from him , too .
You may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy . <eos> I may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy . <eos> But the truck stop dentist figured it out a long time ago . <eos> `` When your dental practice is in a truck stop , you do n't have a lot of patients coming in for their six-month cleanings , '' said Dr. Thomas P. Roemer . <eos> `` You have people walking in holding their jaws in pain . <eos> Treatment is not optional -- they need to see a dentist , and they need to see me now . '' . <eos> Dr. Roemer 's one-man dental office is inside the Iowa 80 Truckstop , at Exit 284 of Interstate 80 , near the small town of Walcott . <eos> The complex proclaims itself to be the world 's largest truck stop , and if you 've never been there -- well , the truck stop itself is probably a story for another time . <eos> Suffice it to say that the establishment is spread over 200 acres , that it features its own movie theater , a 300-seat restaurant with a 50-foot salad bar , the Super Truck Showroom ( more than 75,000 truck-related items for sale , festooned with enough gleaming chrome to make you reach for your sunglasses ) . <eos> But the topic for today is Dr. Roemer , and how he ended up offering root canals in a building where people stop for diesel fuel . <eos> These desperate economic times highlight the importance of individual inventiveness and ingenuity -- and a dentist has to be beyond ingenious to gaze upon an Iowa truck stop and figure out : A fellow could make himself a pretty nice living in there . <eos> `` I had a regular dental practice over in Davenport , '' Dr. Roemer , 48 , told me . <eos> `` I had an advertisement in the Yellow Pages . <eos> And in the early 1990s I noticed that I kept getting calls from truckers who were in a phone booth out by the Iowa 80 Truckstop . <eos> They had stopped for fuel , and they were in a lot of pain , and they absolutely had to see a dentist . '' . <eos> Now ... Walcott , the town adjacent to the truck stop , has only 1,500 residents . <eos> But the truck stop itself caters to an estimated 5,000 customers a day , most of them long-haul truckers passing through . <eos> The light bulb above Dr. Roemer 's head snapped on . <eos> `` I made arrangements with the truck stop to open up an office , '' he said . <eos> `` At first I split my practice between my old office in Davenport and the truck stop office . <eos> But I ended up closing the old one . <eos> My entire practice is in the truck stop now . '' . <eos> Business is good , he said , even during the recession . <eos> There have been stories from around the country about doctors and dentists seeing fewer patients , because people just do n't have the money to come in for regular checkups . <eos> But a truck stop dental office is not a place where patients come because they have planned it -- a truck stop dental office is a place where patients come because they need immediate relief . <eos> `` The sentence I hear the most often is , 'Do you pull teeth ? ' '' . <eos> Dr. Roemer said . <eos> `` Someone will come in with his hand to his face , and he 'll want to have a tooth extracted . <eos> He will have heard that I 'm here . '' . <eos> But how do truckers learn about Dr. Roemer 's practice ? . <eos> `` Word of mouth , '' he said . <eos> ( So to speak . ) . <eos> The business model of most dental offices , he said , is based on teeth-cleaning : A dentist builds up his or her list of loyal patients and their families who come in to get their teeth cleaned , and when they need fillings or crowns , the office is there for them . <eos> The truck stop dentist , by necessity , turns that business model inside out . <eos> `` I usually see a patient once , and then never see him again , '' he said . <eos> `` Truckers are n't going to say to me , ' I 'll be back for a cleaning on September 23 at 2 in the afternoon . ' . <eos> They ca n't plan where they 're going to be . <eos> I make patient files for the people who come in , but I know that I 'll probably never have a reason to open the files after they walk out the door . <eos> These are mostly one-time patients . '' . <eos> He does n't have the luxury of knowing , at the beginning of a day , how many patients he will see -- or even if he will see any . <eos> `` It can range from zero patients in a day to 15 , '' he said . <eos> `` It 's unusual for a patient to call in advance . <eos> I 'll know I have a patient when the door opens and a trucker walks in , with that look on his face . '' . <eos> Dr. Roemer 's success , he said , is based on two factors : the steady flow of those 35,000 people who pull in to the truck stop every week , and the actuarial certainty that some of them will be truckers with a mouthful of hurt . <eos> `` I had a guy who came in yesterday who told me he was in such pain that he had tried to pull his own tooth , '' Dr. Roemer said . <eos> `` I told him there was no need for that . <eos> I told him that I could help him . '' . <eos> It does get a little lonely out at Exit 284 , not being able to build up a continuing relationship with his patients , the way most dentists do . <eos> Sometimes , as a patient is getting up from the chair to leave , Dr. Roemer will find himself saying : . <eos> `` Make sure you try to get your dispatcher to send you back this way . '' .
It 's no secret that liberals throughout the nation are rejoicing at Rush Limbaugh 's supposed status as leader of the Republican Party . <eos> I can see why . <eos> He 's easy to pick on . <eos> His rhetoric is extreme , and his personal life has at times been less than picture-perfect . <eos> I 've heard some pundits refer to Vice President Joe Biden as `` the gift that keeps on giving . '' . <eos> I imagine the left feels the same way about Limbaugh . <eos> Rush was an integral part of my childhood . <eos> I must have been 6 or 7 when I started listening in the late 1980s . <eos> I remember that my parents and their friends found him refreshing , and I remember that he made them laugh . <eos> I memorized his song parodies and even tried to write a few of my own based on the events I heard him talk about . <eos> When I was 11 , I once spent several hours trying to call his show , redialing after every busy signal , over and over . <eos> I never got through . <eos> It 's probably just as well ; I think I had planned to try to talk him into running for president . <eos> I no longer think he 'd make a good president -- we 're all much better off when he sits behind the EIB microphone . <eos> Rush taught me a lot about personal responsibility , the value of freedom of speech and the love of country . <eos> At 26 , I 've outgrown many of my childhood habits , but I never outgrew Rush . <eos> Have conservatives outgrown him ? . <eos> Is it time to distance ourselves by dismissing him as just `` an entertainer , '' as Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele initially did before apologizing ? . <eos> My friend John Mark Reynolds wrote recently that Rush is `` a shallow thinker '' who will alienate today 's young adults rather than draw them in . <eos> He argued that Rush 's `` insider lingo '' and harsh demeanor are problematic at a time when the Republican Party is losing the young adult vote . <eos> Is he right ? . <eos> Has Rush Limbaugh outlived his usefulness to the conservative movement ? . <eos> Should we take a cue from the Democrats ' glee and relegate El Rushbo to a back room like an aging and unpopular distant relative ? . <eos> Not by a long shot . <eos> Rush does n't need to be removed as leader of the Republican Party , because he 's never held that position , much as Democrats would like you to think he has . <eos> He 's a vitally necessary part of the conservative movement , but he 's no one 's leader . <eos> Do n't give him more credit than he deserves , and do n't fall prey to the Democrats ' carefully planned attempts to inflate his authority . <eos> Steele learned the hard way a few days ago that the opposite extreme is also not true -- Rush is not a mere entertainer . <eos> One of his most important contributions to the conservative movement has been his ability to energize the base . <eos> This is particularly vital now given the recent election results . <eos> Someone has to keep the troops from giving up , and like it or not , for now that someone is Rush . <eos> It does n't really matter whether he 's a shallow thinker . <eos> What does matter is that he knows how to prod people into action . <eos> That 's all well and good , but is it sustainable ? . <eos> What works for me and for the many other `` Rush babies '' out there may not work for our younger siblings . <eos> Thanks to the Obama campaign , new activists are n't going to be as easily attracted by witty aphorisms and wordplays as previous demographics were . <eos> President Obama 's impressive rhetorical skills appeared to raise the level of public discourse during the campaign . <eos> As far as I can tell he did n't actually say anything new , but so many things sounded new when he said them . <eos> I do n't think he changed the content of the age-old feud between right and left , but he did change the style , providing a stark contrast to the admittedly strident tones of some on the right . <eos> That 's going to change the way young people all over will approach the political process ; after all , 66 percent of the 29-and-under crowd voted for Obama . <eos> Rush 's personal influence will decline because of this shift in rhetorical style , but we 're not yet at the point where it is unimportant . <eos> The current crop of college students may not call themselves `` dittoheads , '' but their mentors and heroes within the movement still do , and that will continue to be significant for a while yet . <eos> Do we need leaders who can inspire the next generation of young conservatives ? . <eos> Absolutely . <eos> Is Rush the best man for that job ? . <eos> At this point , yes , though that will probably change in the next few years . <eos> One thing is likely -- the next big conservative leaders who do resonate well with the age group that favors Obama will cite Rush as a major influence . <eos> His work wo n't end with him . <eos> And that 's as it should be .
There are so many things that we could take away and remember forever regarding the inauguration of the first African-American president in the history of the United States , but I 'll always remember the laughter of a little girl . <eos> Shortly after President-elect Barack Obama finished the oath and became President Barack Obama , he joined hands with his family and waved to the cheering voices of 1.8 million people packed from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial . <eos> People cried , others hugged , celebrities and everyday folks snapped photos to capture the moment . <eos> There really was an amazing energy that permeated the crowd as we all witnessed a barrier come tumbling down before our eyes . <eos> But what stood out for me was a moment when President Obama looked down at his 7-year-old daughter , Sasha , and she said something to him , and then let out this huge laugh . <eos> I do n't know whether it was her statement or his response , but the bubbly child was having the time of her life . <eos> The sheer joy that was on her face as she grinned from ear to ear caused me to just start laughing as I watched her reaction . <eos> I was shooting photos from the CNN platform just across from where he spoke , and one of the many images was of a beaming Sasha alongside her mom and 10-year-old sister , Malia . <eos> Can you imagine what was going through this young girl 's mind , to see her father stand there and take the oath of office ? . <eos> As I saw her that day , and later bouncing along a sidewalk as she walked with her father , my niece Anastacia came to mind . <eos> Their smiles and bouncy walk are so much alike , and both are the same age . <eos> These young girls , and countless other black children , among others , will grow up in an America where what they can imagine is backed up by what they see . <eos> Despite the reality that racism has n't left us , these children have the advantage of not being burdened with being separated by race . <eos> So much has been written about today 's generation living in a world where hip-hop music brought them all together in one room , coupled with the diverse images on television and movies . <eos> Their reality is not the reality of their parents , and we will see that play out a lot in the future . <eos> What also is most compelling about this age of Obama is how he has been received thus far internationally . <eos> Many political experts are simply stunned that a man who has only been on the national stage for five years would have so much good will across the pond . <eos> Of course , a lot of that has to do with the fact that President George W. Bush and his team were seen as running roughshod over their international partners , praising them when they needed something , and savaging them when they disagreed with the U.S. position . <eos> Yet what we also ca n't ignore is that Obama 's skin tone also plays a central role . <eos> Americans may be shocked to find out that people of color make up two-thirds of the world population . <eos> They know all too well about America 's pathetic and violent history of enslaving and later oppressing African-Americans , and it was always seen as ridiculous for U.S. officials to condemn human rights abuses abroad while racial and other forms of discrimination existed in their own backyard . <eos> Obama 's election sends a powerful signal to the world that Americans are backing up their rhetoric and ideals with action , and Obama serves as that powerful symbol . <eos> Barack Hussein Obama now has the opportunity to show those who voted for him -- and those who did n't -- that the change he often spoke about can come to pass . <eos> If he is able to fulfill many of the promises he made during the campaign , he will go down as one of America 's most successful presidents , looked at fondly by the American people . <eos> And if he does , maybe we 'll end up having the same smile he received courtesy of Sasha .
For two days , news reports called her `` the 20-year old victim '' allegedly attacked by R & B singer and dancer Chris Brown in his car early February 8 in Los Angeles , California . <eos> We all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer Rihanna , Brown 's girlfriend . <eos> The story has dominated the general media with good reason . <eos> Both singers are young , apple-cheek gorgeous , immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you 'd imagine as domestic violence headliners . <eos> Perhaps the only good that will come from the Rihanna/Brown publicity is destruction of our culture 's misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor , uneducated and powerless . <eos> Brown , whose first song debuted at No . <eos> 1 and whose first album topped the Billboard Hot 100 , appeared on a Disney sitcom and in Sesame Street , Got Milk ? . <eos> and Wrigley 's Doublemint Gum commercials . <eos> Barbados-born Rihanna has been big-brothered by music industry legends like Jay-Z and Kanye West and is signed to the Def Jam Recordings label . <eos> She has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene , attaining five Billboard Hot 100 No . <eos> 1 's with `` SOS , '' `` Umbrella , '' `` Take a Bow , '' `` Disturbia '' and T.I . <eos> 's `` Live Your Life . '' . <eos> Like Rihanna , I had a bright future in my early 20s . <eos> I met my abusive lover at 22 . <eos> I 'd just graduated from Harvard and had a job at Seventeen Magazine in New York . <eos> My husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well . <eos> In our world , we were the last couple you 'd imagine enmeshed in domestic violence . <eos> Many of my ex-husband 's attacks also took place in our car . <eos> For reasons I never understood , the enclosed , soundproof space brought out his worst violence . <eos> He punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other . <eos> As trapped in the car as I was in our marriage , it was there that I endured tirades about how controlling I was with money , how flirtatious and naïve I was with other men , how defiant and disrespectful I was of my husband 's authority . <eos> So , I suppose I have more understanding than most about the shame , fury , confusion and disappointment Rihanna may be experiencing . <eos> What 's hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love , hope and sympathy can be . <eos> I first fell for my husband the night he confided how he , like Chris Brown , had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home . <eos> `` He used to hit my mom ... <eos> He made me terrified all the time , terrified like I had to pee on myself , '' Brown said during a 2007 interview with Giant magazine . <eos> Brown has n't explained what happened in the recent incident , but this week he released a statement saying that he 's sorry and saddened by it . <eos> Our culture encourages women to nurture men , making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men , as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past . <eos> In my case , it took four years , myriad terrifying attacks , and the intervention of the police and family court before I understood how little I could help my ex get over his abusive childhood . <eos> I certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship , but unfortunately I was in good company . <eos> The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in America are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year . <eos> Every day , on average , three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends . <eos> At some point in our lives , 25 percent of American women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners , according to the National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <eos> However , these statistics , grim as they are , fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle . <eos> A national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children . <eos> Witnessing abuse , as Chris Brown and my ex-husband did as young boys , is a form of abuse itself . <eos> Tragically , many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves . <eos> I always sensed that my husband did n't want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities . <eos> A few months after I left my marriage , I happened across another couple in another car , late at night on an empty street . <eos> I slowed down as a well-dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white Honda , brushing off a tall , handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans . <eos> Suddenly she turned and tried to run . <eos> He grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront . <eos> Even from my car I could see the fear on her pretty face . <eos> Without thinking , I jerked my car over and got out . <eos> By this time the man had let the woman go and she 'd slid behind the wheel of the car . <eos> He stepped back as I approached , his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted . <eos> I did n't look at him . <eos> I leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel , crying and staring straight ahead . <eos> `` I just left a husband who beat me for three years , '' I said . <eos> `` You do not have to put up with this . <eos> You do not deserve to be treated like this . '' . <eos> `` I know , '' she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face . <eos> She sniffed loudly and shook her head . <eos> She would n't look at me . <eos> Her eyes were rimmed red , but I could see resolve in them . <eos> `` You 're right , '' she said . <eos> `` It 's just taking me longer than I thought . '' . <eos> As I left , I gave the man a long stare . <eos> The spell had been broken and his face was open , sorrowful , filled with hope and fear -- a look I had seen dozens of times on my husband 's face . <eos> How long would that look last before he got angry again ? . <eos> I could feel the woman 's determination as I got back into my car . <eos> I knew she would be all right , one day . <eos> The man , I was less certain about . <eos> Family violence is a criminal act ; perpetrators , while often former victims themselves , need to accept culpability . <eos> Until we can prevent children from witnessing and becoming victims of abuse , the cycle will repeat itself : there will be many more Chris Browns and `` alleged victims '' in our headlines and in our homes .
I have to mention tonight the headline that caught my eye on the CNN Ticker earlier today : `` Porn Industry Seeks Federal Bailout . '' . <eos> Yeah , you heard me . <eos> The porn industry wants a bailout . <eos> Leave it to Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and `` Girls Gone Wild '' CEO Joe Francis to take the absurdity of what is going on now with our federal bailout program to a whole new level . <eos> According to their press release , the adult entertainment industry needs $ 5 billion of your tax money because it , too , has been hit by the economic downturn . <eos> They concede the $ 13 billion industry is in no fear of collapse , but say in this environment , why take chances ? . <eos> I do n't really think this requires commentary or condemnation , just thought you would enjoy it .
Editor 's note : Clarence B. Jones , author of `` What Would Martin Say ? '' . <eos> is Scholar in Residence at the Stanford University Martin Luther King Jr. Research & Education Institute . <eos> He was a lawyer and speechwriter for Dr. King . <eos> Clarence Jones says America is indebted to Martin Luther King Jr. for breaking its addiction to segregation . <eos> Next week , the day after our national holiday commemorating the 80th birthday of Dr. King , Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States , the first African-American elected as president . <eos> Obama 's election would not have been possible without the transformative effect of Dr. King 's struggle , leadership and legacy in dismantling segregation and institutional racism in the United States . <eos> America owes a great debt to Dr. King . <eos> Prior to him , our nation was like a dysfunctional drug addict or alcoholic , hooked and addicted to segregation and institutional racism . <eos> His `` tough love '' of nonviolent direct action civil disobedience forced America to confront its conscience and the immorality of racial injustice . <eos> Dr. King enabled our country to embark on an extraordinary journey of recovery to reclaim its soul . <eos> He enabled us to reactivate those precepts enshrined in our Declaration of Independence : `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights . '' . <eos> In twelve years and four months , from 1956 to April 4 , 1968 -- except for President Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation -- Martin Luther King Jr. may have done more to achieve racial , social and political justice and equality in America than any other person in our country 's history . <eos> Dr. King had confidence in the democratic future of America . <eos> He believed that we , as a people , would be able to `` transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood . '' . <eos> I met Martin Luther King , Jr. for the first time 49 years ago when he visited my home in California to enlist my assistance in the defense of a criminal tax indictment against him by the state of Alabama . <eos> Only six months earlier , I had graduated from Boston University Law School . <eos> I worked for him as a law clerk , political organizer , personal lawyer and , at his request , I drafted speeches for Dr. King until his death on April 4 , 1968 . <eos> He was an ordained Christian minister before he was a civil rights leader . <eos> His religious faith and abiding belief in God were the fuel that ignited the engine of his moral leadership . <eos> President-elect Obama 's religion and belief in God appear central to his political leadership . <eos> During the 40 years following Dr , King 's assassination in Memphis , Tennessee , the most recurring question asked of me has been : `` Who today , what black leader , if anyone , is most like Dr . <eos> King ? '' . <eos> I would consistently answer that Dr. King was sui generis , one of a kind And , then ask rhetorically : `` Who today is most like Michelangelo , Mozart , Galileo , Copernicus , Aristotle , Beethoven or Shakespeare ? '' . <eos> Since Obama 's election , I have been asked : . <eos> • Is Barack Obama another Martin Luther King Jr ? . <eos> • What would Dr. King say about the election of Obama ? . <eos> • Does the election of Obama , as the first African-American president of the United States , mean that Dr. King 's dream has been fulfilled ? . <eos> • Does Obama 's election indicate that racism for all practical purposes no longer exists in America ? . <eos> • Will Obama 's election have any impact on the number of African-American men incarcerated or the high percentage of out-of-wedlock births within the African-American community ? . <eos> There are no easy answers to these questions , but it is clear that those of us in the civil rights movement of the 1960s never anticipated the event we will witness Tuesday . <eos> After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , and the assumption of the presidency by former Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , some of us who worked closely with Dr. King , concluded no fundamental change in race relations in America could be accomplished successfully and sustained unless it was done under the political leadership of a white man from the south , people like Presidents Lyndon Johnson , Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush . <eos> Our belief was predicated on the political assumption that America would be more willing to follow a white southern political leader on the issues of race relations and equal economic opportunity than a politician from another part of our country . <eos> We never contemplated the realistic possibility of a black president of the United States in our lifetimes . <eos> The 1965 Voting Rights Act sparked the prairie fires of subsequent black voter registration and voting which dramatically altered the political landscape of America . <eos> It was this legislative foundation that fostered and facilitated the political possibility of a successful Obama candidacy for president . <eos> `` We Shall Overcome '' was our national anthem of the Civil Rights Movement under Dr. King 's leadership . <eos> President-elect Obama , like a masterful musical composer with perfect pitch , successfully updated , translated and rearranged `` We Shall Overcome '' to a `` Yes , We Can '' surround-sound mantra for the cell phone , YouTube , Facebook , MySpace and Internet-blackberry generation . <eos> This may be the most enduring 21st Century tribute to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr . <eos> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clarence Jones .
While pundits have compared President Obama to Franklin Delano Roosevelt , John F. Kennedy , Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan , less attention has been paid to another , perhaps more apt parallel -- Lyndon Baines Johnson . <eos> Sometimes the similarities are striking . <eos> Both aimed high , seeking major legislation to reshape America -- Johnson with civil rights and Medicare , Obama with health care and energy legislation . <eos> Both Johnson and Obama understood that Congress was a credit-claiming institution whose members did not like to have proposals rammed down their throats . <eos> Johnson 's style of political leadership was famous . <eos> A creature of the Senate , Johnson loved to lean on legislators and intimidate them into supporting his agenda . <eos> As Senate majority leader from 1955 to 1961 , Johnson had been famous for subjecting colleagues to the `` Treatment '' whereby the hulking Texan cornered a legislator in the hallway , stood eye to eye and made his arguments about a bill until he received assurances of support for particular legislation . <eos> Although Johnson slightly changed his posture once he was president , he still relied on this kind of interaction to build support . <eos> As president from November 1963 until January 1969 , Johnson worked closely with the Southern committee chairmen and ranking Republicans who dominated the House and Senate . <eos> Johnson sought to achieve a delicate mix of maintaining control over deliberations -- thinking of ways to obtain what he wanted without giving the appearance of it being a presidential-led idea -- all while responding to the concerns of the chairmen . <eos> The back-and-forth deliberations with House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills over the creation of Medicare in 1965 have become the classic example of how a president can work the chamber while allowing a congressional leader into the room to shape a bill in ways with which he 'll be comfortable . <eos> Johnson agreed to redesign the particulars of the legislation so that the final program would protect the fiscal integrity of Social Security ( under which it was included ) and contain long-run costs . <eos> Thus far , Obama has taken a similar approach with the economic stimulus and , more recently , with his budget proposal . <eos> The president outlined to Congress the basic ideas he wanted in the final product but then left to lawmakers the work of designing the details . <eos> While the downside has been that Obama relinquished control over the structure of the legislation , House and Senate Democrats have felt invested and empowered to produce what Obama 's team viewed as successful results . <eos> The second similarity is that Johnson , like Obama , distanced himself from the arguments of liberals who said that conservatives did not need to be feared . <eos> Johnson was consumed by his fears of a right-wing resurgence , even after trouncing Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election . <eos> Johnson constantly warned advisers that the most dangerous political force in the country as far as he was concerned was not the left on college campuses but what he called the `` reactionary element '' within the GOP , and he took this into consideration when shaping legislative proposals . <eos> With domestic policy , Johnson avoided programs that could be tagged as `` socialistic , '' and on foreign policy he worked hard to demonstrate a tough stance against communism . <eos> Recently released telephone conversations have revealed that Johnson was obsessed with the 1966 midterm elections after the 1964 election was over , realizing that historically those results were not likely to be good for the White House . <eos> Obama has been reluctant to embrace liberal arguments about an end to the Age of Reagan , courting conservative journalists such as David Brooks instead of liberal pundits such as Paul Krugman . <eos> He accepted compromises on legislation in response to moderates in both parties and agreed to a financial bailout that pleased Wall Street , not Main Street . <eos> And his administration has steered clear of explicitly nationalizing banks , a step that could be called socialist . <eos> Obama has even touched on sensitive subjects such as deficit reduction and Social Security reform , which are much more appealing to the right than left . <eos> During one important conversation , Obama told the centrist Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana that he need not worry about his administration going too far on spending since he identified himself as a New Democrat , a reference to members of the party who in the Clinton years believed that they needed to accept some of the arguments of the conservative movement . <eos> Finally , both presidents understood the strategic importance of leveraging social movements to their political advantage . <eos> During the height of the struggles over civil rights , Johnson frequently pointed to the growing power of the grass-roots civil rights movement as he tried to pressure undecided legislators to support legislation to end public segregation and then to ensure voting rights for African-Americans . <eos> Johnson made it clear that the movement had become a potent force in American life , winning the hearts and minds of citizens , and that it could cause political trouble for his opponents . <eos> Obama has shown glimmers of a similar strategy with regard to the budget . <eos> The administration recently announced that it was trying to mobilize the `` net roots '' operation from the 2008 campaign to build pressure on wavering representatives and senators to support his plans on health care and the environment . <eos> The comparisons between Johnson and Obama likewise offer reminders about what could go wrong for the current president . <eos> After all , Johnson was a politician who looked like a transformative president in 1965 but within three years found himself to be a defeated man who withdrew from the Democratic primaries . <eos> Johnson 's fears of the right , moreover , pushed him and America deeper into the deadly war in Vietnam . <eos> The social movements that LBJ used to his benefit in 1964 and 1965 turned against him as the administration plunged deeper into Vietnam , a lesson worth thinking about for the current administration . <eos> Johnson 's policy of respect for committee chairmen prompted him to make compromises over social policy -- such as cuts in social spending in 1968 -- that weakened his support among the very Democrats he needed to win re-election . <eos> Johnson was never fully aware of how his greatest political skills could also become the source of his downfall . <eos> Obama 's challenge is to harness the best parts of this comparison -- such as how Johnson handled Congress to produce dramatic legislative results -- without repeating the destructive characteristics that shattered Johnson 's White House .
The birth of octuplets to a California woman last week raised a boatload of issues that can distract us from the central ethical question posed by the case : How do we take children 's well-being into account in reproductive medicine ? . <eos> Yes , it 's puzzling why an unemployed single woman who already had six children wanted a passel more . <eos> And it is not crazy to wonder who will pay for these children 's needs over the years , beginning with what is sure to be a gobsmacking bill for neonatal intensive care . <eos> For now , we can put aside the lifeboat problem : A human uterus is not built for eight passengers ; the odds for each child to be born alive and healthy go down as the number in the lifeboat goes up . <eos> Her physicians offered to reduce the number of fetuses she was carrying ; citing her moral convictions , she declined . <eos> As of the last reports , all eight survived . <eos> Still , knowing what we do about the many risks that come with being born too soon and too small , their medical course is likely to be complex and unsteady . <eos> What this case really does is split wide open a fault line running through infertility treatment in American medicine . <eos> People who show up at fertility clinics are adults . <eos> In the typical case , they 've been trying to get pregnant for a year or more without success . <eos> When all goes well , a cycle of IVF ( in-vitro fertilization ) results in a pregnancy and the birth of one , perhaps two , healthy babies . <eos> As a son , a father , and now a grandfather , I can attest that there is no more important or enduring relationship in our lives than the one between parents and children . <eos> Whether that relationship is forged through infertility medicine , adoption or the old-fashioned way matters not at all : What counts is that adults who want to love and raise a child are matched with a child who needs just that love and care . <eos> The point of infertility treatment , after all , is to create a child . <eos> But that child-to-be is not the clinic 's patient -- the would-be parents are . <eos> I believe that the interests of those children deserve at least as much consideration as the wishes of the prospective parents . <eos> The vast majority of infertility patients are no doubt fierce advocates for the well-being of the child they so earnestly seek to bring into their lives . <eos> What happens , though , when the client 's request shows little consideration or regard for the welfare of the would-be children ? . <eos> What happens if a woman in her early 30s with six children wants eight embryos implanted all at once ? . <eos> A responsible physician could turn down such a request , citing professional guidelines that counsel implanting one , at most two , embryos in women younger than 35 . <eos> How Nadya Suleman ended up with eight is a mystery . <eos> That 's what Nadya Suleman is claiming . <eos> Perhaps there is a physician somewhere willing to defy the wisdom of his or her peers ; perhaps Suleman used fertility drugs rather than IVF as she claimed . <eos> Whatever the case , this guideline is based on safety . <eos> Carrying more than a couple of fetuses is dangerous to the pregnant woman and to the health and survival of the fetuses in her womb . <eos> Citing safety is a prudent way to turn down requests an infertility physician thinks are ill-considered . <eos> But sometimes that gambit is n't available . <eos> A psychiatrist friend who conducted intake interviews for a well-respected clinic described a rough-looking couple who carried for their up-front payment thousands of dollars in cash stuffed in a bag -- drug money , she was certain . <eos> She was able to discourage the couple from following through on their plan . <eos> Here 's the rub : Her concern was the ultimate well-being of the child that the clinic was being asked to help create . <eos> But the ideology of American infertility medicine allows physicians to escape from making any judgments about the suitability of prospective parents . <eos> There is understandable worry that cracking the door to considerations about parents ' motives and capacities would blast it wide open for nasty , petty stereotypes and prejudices . <eos> That would be an awful result . <eos> The American Society for Reproductive Medicine acknowledged in a 2004 report that fertility programs may withhold services when they can provide `` well-substantiated judgments '' that the child will not receive adequate care . <eos> But that same report has a huge loophole . <eos> Providers can abdicate almost all responsibility to anticipate the welfare of the children they help create by claiming `` an obligation to treat all patients who would benefit from medical treatment . '' . <eos> The statement goes on to say that `` except when significant harm to a future child is likely , '' they `` should not be required to make assessments of a patient 's child-rearing abilities or other child welfare issues . '' . <eos> It 's time for the profession -- and business -- of reproductive medicine to accept their firm , inescapable ethical obligation to give the interests and well-being of the children they help to create the same consideration they give to the desires of the adults they serve .
Peruvians are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week : the conviction of their former president , Alberto Fujimori , for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s . <eos> The Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses , including the massacre of innocent civilians , and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful . <eos> It is one of the first times a nation 's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations . <eos> Equally significant , the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial , which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru 's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law . <eos> Fujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but , in the process of restoring order , he corrupted and weakened Peru 's most vital government institutions -- including parliament , the courts and law enforcement . <eos> Just a few years ago , Fujimori had near-total control of Peru 's judiciary . <eos> For a decade , his government used bribery , extortion , and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency , subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary , legislature , and media on government abuses . <eos> He led Peru from 1990 to 2000 , presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement . <eos> He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads . <eos> Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges . <eos> The landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state . <eos> Just 20 years ago , it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book . <eos> In the late 20th century , Mao Zedong , Idi Amin , Milton Obote , Ferdinand Marcos , Anastasio Somoza , Jean-Claude `` Baby Doc '' Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko , to name just a few , were never brought to trial . <eos> Since then , however , the tide has turned . <eos> In October 1998 , London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes . <eos> The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet 's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere , but more important , they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice . <eos> In country after country , particularly in Latin America , victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and , often , to remain in power . <eos> Thanks to these efforts , former leaders in Argentina , and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials . <eos> Pinochet 's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda , and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished . <eos> After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , the world established the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so . <eos> The ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur . <eos> The Fujimori case stands out , though , because it was Peru 's national court system which demonstrated the will , capacity , and independence to try its former president . <eos> A second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori . <eos> One can hope the second panel will be as transparent and fair as the first . <eos> Even after this verdict , impunity for past atrocities continues to be a major problem in Peru and throughout the region . <eos> It is likely , however , that yesterday 's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice . <eos> The verdict will also send a powerful message to current heads of state who may be tempted to use abusive tactics to resolve their political problems . <eos> As Fujimori discovered yesterday , crimes they may be able to get away with while in power can come back to haunt them years later .
