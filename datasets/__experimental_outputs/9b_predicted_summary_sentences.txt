 Most old incandescent bulbs manufactured are imported from China, where they are mostly manufactured by the Council, the same debt you remember the council bought up by the folks in New Years' holidays in Jersey, who use the profits to send sheet rock to rebuild their houses ravaged by the hurricane.
